## Lake Baikal (Russia)

### Stressor: Climate Change (Lake Baikal)

**Metric:** Water temperature (Â°C); ice cover duration and thickness; changes in stratification; changes in precipitation and evaporation.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Limnological Institute of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
    *   Russian Hydrometeorological Service.
    *   International research collaborations.
    *   Climate models.

**Impact on Area:** Warming waters; reduced ice cover; changes in mixing patterns.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Potential impacts on endemic species (e.g., the Baikal seal, omul fish, and numerous invertebrate species).
    *   Shifts in species distributions.
    *   Increased risk of algal blooms.
    *   Changes in the food web.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Ice Cover (major impact).
    *   Water Temperature.
    *   Ecosystem Functioning.

**Logic Description:** Climate change is a *major* threat to Lake Baikal, with warming waters, reduced ice cover, and potential impacts on the lake's unique and endemic biodiversity. The lake's deep waters are warming, which is a significant concern.

### Stressor: Pollution (Lake Baikal)

**Metric:** Concentrations of pollutants (e.g., nutrients, heavy metals, organic pollutants) in water and sediments.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Limnological Institute of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
    *   Russian environmental monitoring agencies.
    *   Research studies.

**Impact on Area:** Localized pollution hotspots, particularly near industrial areas.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Potential toxic effects on organisms.
    *   Impacts on endemic species.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Industrial Discharge: From pulp and paper mills and other industries (historically a major source, though regulations have improved).
    *   Atmospheric Deposition.
    *   Wastewater from settlements around the lake.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Water Quality.
    *   Wildlife Health.

**Logic Description:** Pollution from industrial sources, atmospheric deposition, and wastewater discharge poses a threat to Lake Baikal's water quality and unique biodiversity.  The Baikal Pulp and Paper Mill was a major historical source, and while it has closed, legacy pollution remains a concern.

### Stressor: Poaching

**Metric**: Numbers of illegally harvested endemic species

**Data Sources:**
 * Government reports

**Impact on Area**: N/A

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
* Population decline of endemic species

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
         * Demand for rare/valuable species.
        * Economic hardship.

**Influences (Stressors):**
 * Population levels

**Logic Description:** Illegal hunting, especially the endemic seal.
