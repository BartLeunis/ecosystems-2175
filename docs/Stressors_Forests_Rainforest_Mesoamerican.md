## Mesoamerican Forests

### Stressor: Infrastructure Development (Mesoamerican Forests)

**Metric:** Length of new roads (km/year); area affected by other projects (dams, etc.) (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Government and industry reports.
    *   Remote sensing data.
    *   NGO reports.

**Impact on Area:** Direct loss and fragmentation.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss and fragmentation.
    *   Increased access for hunting/poaching.
    *   Disruption of ecological corridors.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Economic Growth: Tourism, agriculture, resource extraction.
    *   Population Growth.
    *   Government Policies.
    *   Global Commodity Prices.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Deforestation.
    *   Wildfires.
    *   Pollution.

**Logic Description:** Infrastructure development, driven by various economic activities, leads to habitat loss and facilitates other stressors.

### Stressor: Deforestation (Mesoamerican Forests)

**Metric:** Area of forest cleared per year (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote sensing data.
    *   NGO and research reports.
    *   Government data.

**Impact on Area:** Direct reduction.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss and fragmentation.
    *   Loss of carbon storage.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Infrastructure Development.
    *   Economic Growth: Agriculture (cattle ranching, coffee, palm oil), logging.
    *   Population Growth: Subsistence agriculture.
    *   Government Policies.
    * Global Commodity Prices

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Wildfires.
    * Changes in Precipitation

**Logic Description:** Deforestation, driven by agricultural expansion (including cattle ranching and, increasingly, palm oil), logging, and subsistence farming, is a major threat.

### Stressor: Temperature Increase (Mesoamerican Forests)

**Metric:** Average annual temperature increase (Â°C).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Global and regional climate models.
    *   Historical data.

**Impact on Area:** Indirect.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Species shifts.
    *   Physiological stress.
    * Increased risk of coral bleaching in coastal areas.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.
    *   Deforestation.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Wildfires.
    *   Changes in Precipitation.

**Logic Description:** Global warming impacts, with potential impacts on both terrestrial and coastal ecosystems (e.g., coral reefs).

---

### Stressor: Changes in Precipitation (Mesoamerican Forests)

**Metric:** Change in annual precipitation (mm/year); dry season changes.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Climate models.
    *   Historical data.

**Impact on Area:** Indirect.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Species shifts.
    *   Drought stress.
    * Altered hurricane patterns.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.
    *   Deforestation (potentially).

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Wildfires.

**Logic Description:** Changes in rainfall patterns and potential changes in hurricane frequency/intensity, linked to climate change.

---

### Stressor: Wildfires (Mesoamerican Forests)

**Metric:** Number of fires; area burned (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote sensing data.
    *   Local reports.

**Impact on Area:** Direct loss.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Mortality.
    *   Habitat loss.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Deforestation.
    *   Temperature Increase.
    *   Changes in Precipitation.
    *   Human Activities (agricultural burning).

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Deforestation.

**Logic Description:** Wildfires, often linked to land clearing and exacerbated by climate change.
