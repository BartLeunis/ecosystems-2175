## Atacama Desert

### Stressor: Mining (Atacama Desert)

**Metric:** Area affected by mining operations (ha); water use by mining; pollution levels (e.g., heavy metals).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Chilean government mining records.
    *   Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs).
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** *Major* impacts on water resources; habitat destruction; pollution.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Impacts on extremely limited water resources and the unique species that depend on them.
    *   Potential for toxic effects from pollutants.
    *   Habitat destruction.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Demand for Minerals: (copper, lithium).
    *   Government Policies.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Water Resources: *Critical* in this hyper-arid environment.
    *   Pollution.

**Logic Description:** Mining, particularly for copper and lithium, is a *dominant* stressor in the Atacama, with *major* impacts on extremely limited water resources and unique, highly adapted biodiversity.

### Stressor: Water Extraction (Atacama Desert)

**Metric:** Volume of water extracted (mÂ³/year); changes in groundwater levels; impacts on oases.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Chilean government water resource agencies.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** *Severe* water scarcity; loss of oases.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of water sources for wildlife and vegetation.
    *   Impacts on unique and endemic species.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Mining Activities: *Very* high water demand.
    *   Agriculture (limited, but present in some areas).
    *   Human Consumption.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Water Availability: The *defining* factor.

**Logic Description:** Water extraction, primarily for mining, is a *critical* threat in the hyper-arid Atacama, impacting the extremely limited water resources and the unique biodiversity that depends on them.
