### Stressor: Infrastructure Development (East Asian Temperate Forests)

**Metric:** Road density (km/km²); area affected by development (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   National government statistics.
    *   Remote sensing.

**Impact on Area:** Habitat fragmentation.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss and fragmentation.
    *   Disruption of corridors.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**

### Stressor: Deforestation (East Asian Temperate Forests)

**Metric:** Area of forest cleared per year (ha/year) (localized; overall forest cover may be increasing in some areas due to afforestation, but loss of *natural* forest is a concern).

**Data Sources:**
    *   National forest inventories.
    *   Remote sensing.

**Impact on Area:** Localized forest loss; changes in forest age/type.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss.
    *   Changes in species composition.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Infrastructure Development.
    *   Urban Sprawl.
    *   Agricultural Expansion (in some areas).
    *   Timber Harvesting.

**Influences (Stressors):**
        * Forest Composition

**Logic Description:** Localized deforestation and conversion of natural forest to plantations continue to be stressors.

    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
     * Wildfires (in some areas)
      * Water availability.

**Logic Description:** Changes in precipitation patterns, including changes in monsoon intensity and distribution, impact water resources and ecosystems.
