# Cosmic Betrayal: Humanity’s Silent War on Earth’s Biodiversity

We’re not just losing a planet—we’re squandering a cosmic gift. For 4 billion years, Earth’s ecosystems stitched a fragile, dazzling web of life. Now, in a blink of history, we’re torching it. My Monte Carlo simulation ([GitHub: ecosystems-2175](https://github.com/BartLeunis/ecosystems-2175)) lays bare the stakes: without intervention, 60–66.5% of Earth’s biodiversity—spanning ~97.5% of species—could be gone by 2175. This isn’t a quiet decline; it’s a betrayal of the universe’s rarest fluke.

## The Numbers Don’t Lie
The High scenario—unrestrained warming at 4–6°C plus nuclear risk—shows ecosystems unraveling at breakneck speed. From the Amazon to Freshwater, losses pile up by 2175:

| Ecosystem           | Mean Loss (%) | 95% CI (%)    |
|---------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Amazon Rainforest   | 90.0          | 90.0–90.0     |
| Coral Reefs         | 87.7          | 59.8–95.0     |
| Freshwater          | 80.0          | 80.0–80.0     |
| Total Loss          | 66.5          | 51.2–70.8     |

Even the Low scenario hits 60.3% (CI 20.0–71.8%), crossing 50% by 2125 (54.8%). Mid lands at 64.1% (CI 41.2–70.6%). Every path screams crisis: 50% loss by 2125—food chains buckle, health falters. At 66.5% in High, with a tail risk brushing 70.8%, survival itself teeters. These aren’t guesses; they’re cold, hard probabilities.

## A Cosmic Reckoning
Imagine the odds: a speck of rock, third from a modest star, defies entropy to bloom with life. Earth’s biodiversity isn’t just our backyard—it’s a galactic anomaly. Yet we’re shredding it. The Amazon flips to savanna, coral reefs bleach to ghosts, freshwater dries up—cascades rippling from Tundra to Oceans. By 2125, 64.3% gone in High means famine isn’t a “maybe.” By 2175, 66.5%—with a 70.8% upper bound—hints at collapse we can’t outrun. This isn’t science fiction; it’s our ledger.

## Wake Up or Fade Out
Citizen science like this isn’t a hobby—it’s a siren. We can’t rewind cosmic luck, but we can stop this self-inflicted wound. Intervention isn’t optional; it’s survival. Act now, or Earth’s tapestry—and our place in it—frays to dust.
