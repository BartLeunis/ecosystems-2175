# Cosmic Betrayal: Humanity’s Silent War on Earth’s Biodiversity

We stand at a precipice—not of our making, but of our neglect. For billions of years, Earth’s ecosystems wove a tapestry of life, resilient yet intricate. Now, in mere centuries, we’re unraveling it, thread by thread. My Monte Carlo simulation ([GitHub: ecosystems-2175](https://github.com/BartLeunis/ecosystems-2175)) projects a grim future: without intervention, 65–70% of modeled biodiversity—covering 70% of Earth’s species—could vanish by 2175. This isn’t just a loss of nature; it’s a betrayal of the cosmic luck that gave us this planet.

## The Numbers Speak
The High scenario, fueled by unchecked warming and nuclear risk, shows ecosystems like the Amazon, Coral Reefs, and Oceans collapsing near 100%. Here’s the toll by 2175:

| Ecosystem           | Mean Loss (%) | 95% CI (%)    |
|---------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Amazon Rainforest   | 98.5          | 95.2–100      |
| Coral Reefs         | 99.8          | 97.5–100      |
| Oceans              | 88.9          | 85.3–92.4     |
| Total Modeled Loss  | 66.5          | 63.2–69.8     |

## A Cosmic Perspective
Life’s rarity in the universe makes this betrayal stark. Earth’s biodiversity isn’t just a resource—it’s a miracle. Yet we push past tipping points: 50% loss risks food security; 70% threatens our survival. By 2125, we’re at 55%—famine looms. By 2175, 66.5%—collapse beckons. This isn’t alarmism; it’s math.

## Call to Action
Citizen science, like this simulation, screams for intervention. We can’t undo cosmic time, but we can halt this war. Act now—before Earth’s tapestry frays beyond repair.
