## Seamounts

### Stressor: Bottom Trawling

**Metric:** Area of seamounts trawled (km²/year); frequency of trawling; damage to coral and sponge communities.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Fisheries data (often incomplete for seamounts).
    *   Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) data.
    *   Underwater surveys (using ROVs and submersibles).
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Severe physical destruction of benthic habitats; removal of habitat-forming species (corals, sponges).

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   High mortality of benthic organisms, including long-lived and slow-growing species.
    *   Loss of biodiversity hotspots.
    *   Disruption of seamount food webs.
    *   Reduced structural complexity.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Demand for Deep-Sea Fish: (e.g., orange roughy, which often aggregate on seamounts).
    *   Fishing Technology.
    *   Weak Governance and Enforcement.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Habitat Destruction (primary impact).

**Logic Description:** Bottom trawling is *extremely* destructive to seamount ecosystems, physically destroying the fragile habitats and the diverse communities they support. Recovery, if possible, takes centuries.

### Stressor: Deep-Sea Mining (Seamounts)

**Metric:** Area of seamounts licensed for exploration or exploitation (km²); concentrations of target minerals (e.g., cobalt crusts).

**Data Sources:**
    *   International Seabed Authority (ISA).
    *   National government data.
    *   Research publications.
    *   Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs).

**Impact on Area:** Removal of cobalt crusts (which form on seamounts); potential for sediment plumes.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Destruction of habitat and associated communities.
    *   Potential for long-term impacts.
    *   Release of toxic substances.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Demand for Cobalt and Other Minerals.
    *   Technological Advancements.
    *   International Regulations.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    * Habitat destruction
    *   Water Quality.

**Logic Description:** Mining for cobalt crusts on seamounts poses a significant threat, involving the direct removal of the substrate and the diverse communities that live on it.

### Stressor: Climate Change (Seamounts)

**Metric:** Changes in temperature, ocean currents, oxygen levels, and pH at seamount depths.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Oceanographic data (sparse for seamounts).
    *   Climate models.

**Impact on Area:** Changes in the physical and chemical environment.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Potential shifts in species distributions.
    *   Impacts on physiology and reproduction.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Ocean Acidification.

**Logic Description:** While seamounts are less directly impacted by surface warming, changes in ocean currents, oxygen levels, and acidification driven by climate change could still affect seamount ecosystems.

### Stressor: Plastic Pollution

**Metric:** Plastic and microplastic abundance.

**Data Sources:**
 * ROV surveys.
 * Sediment samples.

**Impact on Area:** Pollution

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
* Ingestion by animals.
* Potential toxic effects.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
         * Plastic production and disposal.

**Influences (Stressors):**
  * Marine life.

**Logic Description:** Plastics reach even remote seamounts.
