## Russian Boreal Forest

### Stressor: Infrastructure Development (Russian Boreal Forest)

**Metric:** Road density (km/km²); area affected by resource extraction (mining, oil and gas, forestry) (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Russian government data (where available).
    *   Remote sensing.
    *   Reports from environmental organizations and research institutions.

**Impact on Area:** Habitat fragmentation; direct loss.

**Impact on Biodiversity:** Same as Canadian Boreal Forest

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Economic Growth: Resource extraction.
    *   Government Policies.
    *   Global Commodity Prices.

**Influences (Stressors):**
     * Deforestation.
    *   Wildfires.
     * Pollution

**Logic Description:** Similar to Canada, but with potentially less stringent environmental regulations and enforcement in some areas. Resource extraction (oil, gas, minerals, timber) is a major driver.

### Stressor: Deforestation (Russian Boreal Forest)

**Metric:** Area of forest cleared per year (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Russian government data (where available).
    *   Remote sensing.
    *   Reports from environmental organizations.

**Impact on Area:** Changes in forest age structure; localized loss.

**Impact on Biodiversity:** Same as Canadian Boreal Forest

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Infrastructure Development.
    *   Economic Growth: Demand for timber (legal and illegal logging).
    *   Government Policies.

**Influences (Stressors):**
     * Carbon Cycle

**Logic Description:** Logging (both legal and illegal) is a major driver of deforestation.

### Stressor: Temperature Increase (Russian Boreal Forest)

**Metric:** Average annual temperature increase (°C).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Climate models.
    *   Historical records.

**Impact on Area:** Indirect; thawing permafrost.

**Impact on Biodiversity:** Same as Canadian Boreal Forest, plus increased risk of Siberian silk moth outbreaks.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Wildfires.
    *   Changes in Precipitation.
    *   Permafrost Thaw.
    * Insect outbreaks

**Logic Description:** Similar to Canada, with rapid warming and significant impacts from thawing permafrost.

### Stressor: Changes in Precipitation (Russian Boreal Forest)

**Metric:** Change in annual precipitation (mm/year); changes in snowpack; seasonality.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Climate models.
    *   Historical records.

**Impact on Area:** Indirect; changes in water availability and permafrost.

**Impact on Biodiversity:** Same as Canadian Boreal Forest

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
   * Wildfires.
   * Permafrost Thaw
  * Water Resources

**Logic Description:** Similar to Canada.

### Stressor: Wildfires (Russian Boreal Forest)

**Metric:** Number of fires; area burned (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Russian government data (where available).
    *   Remote sensing.
    *   Reports from environmental organizations.

**Impact on Area:** Direct loss of forest; changes in structure and age.

**Impact on Biodiversity:** Same as Canadian Boreal Forest, potentially larger scale.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Temperature Increase.
    *   Changes in Precipitation.
    *   Insect outbreaks.
    *   Lightning strikes.
    * Human Activities
    * Inadequate Fire Management

**Influences (Stressors):**
 * Air quality
 * Future Risk
* Carbon cycle

**Logic Description:** Wildfires are a massive and growing problem in the Russian Boreal Forest, driven by climate change and, in some cases, inadequate fire management.

### Stressor: Permafrost Thaw (Russian Boreal Forest)

**Metric:** Active layer thickness (cm); area of permafrost degradation (ha).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Field measurements.
    *   Remote sensing.
    *   Climate models.

**Impact on Area:** Changes in ground stability; altered hydrology; greenhouse gas release.

**Impact on Biodiversity:** Same as Canadian Boreal Forest

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Temperature Increase.
    *   Changes in Precipitation (snow cover).
    *   Wildfires.
    * Infrastructure development

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Climate Change (through greenhouse gas emissions).
     * Hydrology
      * Habitat Loss

**Logic Description:** Similar to Canada, with vast areas of permafrost and significant potential for greenhouse gas release.
