## European Salt Marshes

### Stressor: Sea Level Rise and Coastal Squeeze

**Metric:** Rate of sea level rise; marsh elevation; accretion rates; length of coastline with hard defenses.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Tide gauge records.
    *   Satellite altimetry.
    *   Research publications.
    *   European Environment Agency (EEA) data.

**Impact on Area:** Inundation; erosion; loss of marsh area due to coastal squeeze.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss.
    *   Species shifts.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.
    *   Coastal Development: Prevents landward migration.
    *   Hard Coastal Defenses: Dikes, seawalls.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Coastal Erosion.
    *   Habitat Loss (the dominant impact).

**Logic Description:** Sea level rise is a significant threat, and *coastal squeeze* (due to extensive coastal development and hard defenses) is a *major* problem, preventing marshes from migrating inland.

### Stressor: Land Reclamation (Historical and Ongoing)

**Metric:** Area of salt marsh converted to other land uses (agriculture, development) (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Historical maps and records.
    *   Land-use planning data.
    *   Remote sensing.

**Impact on Area:** *Significant* historical loss of salt marsh habitat; ongoing losses in some areas.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Agricultural Expansion: Historically, many European salt marshes were diked and drained for agriculture.
    *   Coastal Development.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Habitat Loss (a major historical impact).

**Logic Description:**  A large proportion of European salt marshes have been *historically* lost due to land reclamation for agriculture and development. This is a legacy effect that continues to influence the current state of these ecosystems.

### Stressor: Pollution

**Metric:** Concentrations of pollutants

**Data Sources:**
  * Water Quality Monitoring
 * Research

**Impact on Area:** Water and Sediment

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
 * Impacts marsh plants and animals

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    * Industrial discharge
    *  Agricultural Runoff
    * Urban Runoff

**Influences (Stressors):**
 * Water quality
 * Marsh health

**Logic Description:** Pollution from industrial, agricultural, and urban sources.
