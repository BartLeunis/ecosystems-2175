## Australian Seagrass

### Stressor: Climate Change (Australian Seagrass)

**Metric:** Sea surface temperature (Â°C); frequency and severity of marine heatwaves; ocean acidification (pH); sea level rise.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM).
    *   CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation).
    *   Climate models.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Seagrass die-offs (have occurred during marine heatwaves); changes in seagrass distribution.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of habitat.
    *   Shifts in species composition.
    *   Increased vulnerability to other stressors.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Marine Heatwaves (a primary driver of recent die-offs).
    *   Ocean Acidification.
    *   Sea Level Rise.

**Logic Description:** Climate change, particularly marine heatwaves, has caused significant seagrass die-offs in parts of Australia. Ocean acidification and sea level rise are also long-term threats.

### Stressor: Water Quality Degradation

**Metric:** Water clarity (turbidity); nutrient concentrations; concentrations of other pollutants.

**Data Sources:**
    *   State government environmental monitoring programs (e.g., Queensland, Western Australia).
    *   Research studies (e.g., from universities, CSIRO).

**Impact on Area:** Reduced light penetration; stress on seagrasses.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Reduced seagrass growth and survival.
    *   Algal blooms.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Agricultural Runoff: Nutrients and sediments.
    *   Urban Runoff: Pollutants and sediments.
    *   Coastal Development.
    *   Dredging.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Light Availability.
    *   Seagrass Health.

**Logic Description:** Reduced water quality, due to runoff from agriculture, urban areas, and coastal development, is a significant threat to Australian seagrass meadows.

### Stressor: Physical Damage

**Metric:** Area damaged

**Data Sources:**
 * Research
  * Monitoring

**Impact on Area:** Localized loss and fragmentation

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    * Habitat loss

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
     * Coastal development, boating, dredging

**Influences (Stressors):**
    * Habitat Fragmentation

**Logic Description:** Physical damage.
