## Pacific Northwest Kelp Forests (Alaska, British Columbia, Washington)

### Stressor: Ocean Warming

**Metric:** Sea surface temperature (SST) (Â°C); frequency and severity of marine heatwaves.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Satellite data.
    *   In-situ temperature loggers.
    *   Climate models.
     * NOAA
      * Fisheries and Oceans Canada

**Impact on Area:** Reduced kelp growth and survival; potential for die-offs.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of habitat.
    *   Changes in community structure.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Sea Urchin Grazing (indirectly).

**Logic Description:**  Rising ocean temperatures, especially marine heatwaves, stress kelp.

### Stressor: Sea Urchin Grazing / "Urchin Barrens"

**Metric:** Sea urchin density; kelp cover; sea otter abundance.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Underwater surveys.
    *   Research studies.
     * Government monitoring

**Impact on Area:** Conversion of kelp forests to urchin barrens.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Dramatic reduction in biodiversity.
    *   Loss of habitat.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Sea Otter Abundance: Sea otters are key predators.  Where otters are present and healthy, urchin populations are generally controlled. Where otters are absent or reduced, urchin barrens can form.
    *   Overfishing of Other Urchin Predators.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Kelp Forest Cover.

**Logic Description:** The sea otter/urchin/kelp dynamic is crucial. While sea otter populations are generally healthier in the Pacific Northwest than in parts of California, localized urchin barrens can still occur.

### Stressor: Water Pollution

**Metric:** Concentrations of pollutants (nutrients, sediments, etc.).

**Data Sources:**
 * Water Quality monitoring
 * Research studies

**Impact on Area:** Reduced water quality

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
     * Can harm kelp and other organisms.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    * Runoff
 * Industrial discharge

**Influences (Stressors):**
  * Kelp health
  * Water clarity

**Logic Description:** Pollution from various sources.
