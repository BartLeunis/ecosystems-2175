### Stressor: Deforestation (Inner Niger Delta)

**Metric:** Area of forest cleared (ha/year), particularly in the floodplain.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote sensing data.
    *   Local reports.
    *   Research studies.

**Impact on Area:** Loss of trees within and around the delta.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of habitat for birds and other wildlife.
    *   Increased soil erosion and sedimentation in the delta.
    *   Reduced availability of fuelwood (impacting local communities).

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Population Growth: Increased demand for fuelwood and land.
    *   Agricultural Expansion: Clearing land for crops.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Water Quality (through increased sedimentation).
    *   Habitat Availability

**Logic Description:** Deforestation, driven by population growth and agricultural expansion, is impacting both biodiversity and the livelihoods of communities that depend on forest resources.
