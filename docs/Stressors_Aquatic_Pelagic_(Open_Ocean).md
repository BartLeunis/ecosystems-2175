## Open Ocean (Pelagic) (General)

### Stressor: Overfishing (Open Ocean)

**Metric:** Fish catches (tonnes/year); fishing effort (e.g., number of vessels, days at sea); stock assessments (estimates of fish population size and biomass); bycatch (amount of non-target species caught).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Fisheries data (reported catches, often incomplete).
    *   Stock assessments (conducted by regional fisheries management organizations - RFMOs - and national agencies).
    *   Scientific research (e.g., using tagging studies to track fish movements).
    *   Observer programs (placing observers on fishing vessels to monitor catches and bycatch).

**Impact on Area:** Not directly applicable (fishing occurs throughout the water column), but affects the entire ecosystem.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Depletion of fish stocks (target species and bycatch).
    *   Changes in the structure of marine food webs (e.g., removal of top predators).
    *   Impacts on seabirds, marine mammals, and sea turtles (through bycatch and competition for food).
    *   Loss of genetic diversity within fish populations.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Demand for Seafood: Growing human population and increasing per capita consumption.
    *   Fishing Technology: Advances in fishing gear and vessel capabilities.
    *   Subsidies: Government subsidies can encourage overfishing.
    *   Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing.
    *   Weak Governance and Enforcement: Ineffective management of fisheries.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Marine Food Webs: Disrupts trophic relationships.
    *   Ecosystem Functioning.

**Logic Description:** Overfishing is a major threat to the open ocean, depleting fish stocks, altering food web structure, and impacting a wide range of marine species.

### Stressor: Climate Change (Open Ocean)

**Metric:** Sea surface temperature (SST) (Â°C); ocean acidification (pH); changes in ocean currents; changes in stratification (layering of the water column); oxygen minimum zone expansion.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Climate models.
    *   Oceanographic data (buoys, ships, satellites).
    *   Historical records.

**Impact on Area:** Widespread changes in ocean conditions.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Shifts in species distributions (as species track suitable temperatures).
    *   Increased stress on marine organisms (due to warming, acidification, and reduced oxygen).
    *   Changes in phenology (timing of biological events).
    *   Impacts on primary productivity (phytoplankton growth).
    *   Increased frequency and intensity of marine heatwaves.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Ocean Acidification.
    *   Ocean Currents.
    *   Stratification.
    *   Oxygen Minimum Zones.

**Logic Description:** Climate change is causing widespread and fundamental changes to the open ocean, impacting temperature, acidity, currents, stratification, and oxygen levels, with cascading effects on marine life.

### Stressor: Plastic Pollution (Open Ocean)

**Metric:** Concentrations of plastic debris (macroplastics, microplastics) in surface waters, the water column, and sediments; abundance of plastic ingested by marine organisms.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Surface water sampling (using nets).
    *   Beach surveys.
    *   Analysis of the stomach contents of marine animals.
    *   Research studies.

**Impact on Area:** Widespread contamination of the ocean with plastic.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Entanglement of marine animals (e.g., seabirds, turtles, marine mammals).
    *   Ingestion of plastic by marine animals (leading to starvation, blockage of digestive tracts, and exposure to toxic chemicals).
    *   Potential for microplastics to accumulate in the food chain.
    *   Transport of invasive species (on plastic debris).

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Land-Based Sources: Improper waste disposal, runoff from rivers.
    *   Shipping Activities.
    *   Fishing Gear (lost or discarded).

**Influences (Stressors):**
      * Wildlife mortality

**Logic Description:** Plastic pollution is a pervasive problem in the open ocean, impacting marine life through entanglement, ingestion, and the potential for toxic effects.

### Stressor: Chemical Pollution (Open Ocean)

**Metric:** Concentrations of pollutants (e.g., heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), oil) in seawater, sediments, and marine organisms.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Water quality monitoring programs.
    *   Sediment analysis.
    *   Analysis of tissues from marine organisms.
    *   Research studies.

**Impact on Area:** Contamination of the ocean environment.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Toxic effects on marine organisms (e.g., reproductive impairment, immune suppression).
    *   Bioaccumulation of pollutants in the food chain (leading to higher concentrations in top predators).

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Industrial Discharge.
    *   Agricultural Runoff.
    *   Shipping Activities (oil spills, discharge of waste).
    *   Atmospheric Deposition: Pollutants can travel long distances through the air.

**Influences (Stressors):**
        * Wildlife health

**Logic Description:** Chemical pollution from various sources contaminates the open ocean, impacting marine life through toxic effects and bioaccumulation.

### Stressor: Noise Pollution (Open Ocean)
**Metric:** Ambient noise levels; frequency and intensity of anthropogenic noise.

**Data Sources:**
     * Hydrophones
     * Research

**Impact on Area:** Increased noise levels in the ocean.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
   * Interference with communication
    *   Behavioral changes.
   * Stress
    *   Hearing damage (in extreme cases).

    * Shipping
   * Sonar
 * Seismic surveys
   * Construction
