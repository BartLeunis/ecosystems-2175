    *   Global Commodity Prices
    *   Population Growth
    *   Government Policies

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Wildfires
    *   Peatland Degradation

**Logic Description:** Palm oil plantation expansion is the dominant driver, along with logging and other agricultural expansion. Significant impact on peatlands (see below).

### Stressor: Temperature Increase (Southeast Asian Rainforest/Sundaland)

**Metric:** Average annual temperature increase (Celsius)

**Data Sources:**
    *   Global and Regional climate models.
    *   Limited historical data.

**Impact on Area**: Indirect

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Species shifts
    *   Physiological Stress

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global GHG Emissions
    *   Deforestation
    *   Peatland Degradation

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Wildfires
    *   Changes in Precipitation

**Logic Description:** Global warming amplified by deforestation and peatland degradation.

### Stressor: Changes in Precipitation (Southeast Asian Rainforest/Sundaland)

**Metric:** Change in annual precipitation; dry season length/severity

**Data Sources:**
    *   Climate models.
    *   Limited historical data.

**Impact on Area:** Indirect

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Species shifts
    *   Drought stress

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global GHG Emissions
    *   Deforestation

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Wildfires
    *   Peatland Fires

**Logic Description:** Changes in rainfall patterns and increased drought risk.

### Stressor: Wildfires (Southeast Asian Rainforest/Sundaland)

**Metric:** Number of fires, Area Burned

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote Sensing.
    *   Local reports.

**Impact on Area**: Direct loss, particularly of peatland.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Mortality.
    *   Habitat loss.
    *   Severe air pollution (haze).

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Deforestation.
    *   Temperature Increase.
    *   Changes in Precipitation.
    *   Peatland Drainage.
    *   Human Activities (land clearing).

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Deforestation.
    *   Peatland Degradation.
    *   Climate Change (through massive carbon emissions).

**Logic Description:** Wildfires, often intentionally set for land clearing (especially for palm oil), are a HUGE problem in Sundaland/Southeast Asia, particularly due to the presence of peatlands. These fires release massive amounts of carbon and cause severe regional air pollution.

### Stressor: Peatland Degradation (Southeast Asian Rainforest/Sundaland)

**Metric**: Area of drained peatland (ha/year); Depth of water table in peatlands (meters)

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote sensing (measuring subsidence, vegetation changes).
    *   Field measurements of water table depth.
    *   Reports from organizations specializing in peatland conservation.

**Impact on Area:** Loss of peatland ecosystem (which is a distinct subset of the rainforest area).

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of specialized peat swamp forest species.
    *   Massive carbon emissions (peat is a huge carbon store).
    *   Increased fire risk.
    *   Subsidence (land sinking), leading to flooding and infrastructure damage.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Infrastructure Development (drainage canals).
    *   Deforestation (clearing of peat swamp forests).
    *   Agricultural Expansion (primarily palm oil and pulpwood plantations).
    *   Climate Change (changes in precipitation and temperature can exacerbate drying).

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Wildfires (drained peat is highly flammable).
    *   Climate Change (through carbon emissions).
    *   Flooding (due to subsidence).

**Logic Description:** Peatlands are waterlogged ecosystems with thick layers of partially decayed organic matter. Drainage for agriculture (especially palm oil) and logging causes the peat to decompose, releasing massive amounts of carbon dioxide. Drained peat is also extremely vulnerable to fire. This is a critical stressor specific to Sundaland/Southeast Asia (and to a lesser extent, other areas with peat swamp forests).
