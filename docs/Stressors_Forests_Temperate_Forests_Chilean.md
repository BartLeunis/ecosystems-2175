## Chilean Temperate Rainforests

### Stressor: Infrastructure Development (Chilean Temperate Rainforests)

**Metric:** Road density (km/km²); area affected by development (hydroelectric, etc.) (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Government statistics.
    *   Remote sensing.

**Impact on Area:** Habitat fragmentation.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss and fragmentation.
    *   Disruption of corridors.
    *   Impacts on aquatic systems (from dams).

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Economic Growth: Resource extraction (timber, hydropower).
    *   Government Policies.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Deforestation.
    * Water quality (Dams)

**Logic Description:** Infrastructure development, including roads and hydroelectric projects, fragments habitat.

### Stressor: Deforestation (Chilean Temperate Rainforests)

**Metric:** Area of forest cleared per year (ha/year) (often conversion to plantations).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Government statistics.
    *   Remote sensing.

**Impact on Area:** Loss of native forest; changes in forest type.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss (especially for old-growth dependent species).
    *   Changes in species composition.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Infrastructure Development.
    *   Economic Growth: Demand for timber and pulp.
    *   Government Policies: Forestry regulations.

**Influences (Stressors):**
     * Carbon Storage

**Logic Description:** Conversion of native forest to plantations (e.g., eucalyptus, pine) is a major driver of deforestation.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
     * Wildfires (in some areas)
     * Water resources

**Logic Description:** Changes in precipitation patterns, including potential for increased drought in some areas, impact ecosystems.

### Stressor: Wildfires (Chilean Temperate Rainforests)

**Metric:** Number of fires; area burned (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Government statistics.
    *   Remote sensing.

**Impact on Area:** Direct loss of forest area; changes in forest structure.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Mortality.
    *   Habitat loss.
    *   Changes in species composition.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Temperature Increase.
    *   Changes in Precipitation (drier conditions).
    *   Land Use Practices (plantations).
    *   Human Activities (negligence, arson).

**Influences (Stressors):**
    * Future fire risk

**Logic Description:** Wildfires, becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change and land use, are a growing threat.
