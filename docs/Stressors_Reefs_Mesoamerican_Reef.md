## Mesoamerican Reef

### Stressor: Overfishing

**Metric:** Fish biomass, size structure, and abundance of key species (e.g., groupers, snappers, parrotfish).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Fisheries data (often limited and unreliable).
    *   Underwater surveys (conducted by research organizations and conservation groups).
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Not directly applicable, but affects ecosystem structure.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Decline of important fish species.
    *   Disruption of the food web (e.g., loss of herbivores can lead to algal overgrowth).
    *   Loss of top predators.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   High Fishing Pressure: Due to local dependence on fishing and tourism.
    *   Weak Enforcement of Fisheries Regulations.
    *   Lack of Alternative Livelihoods.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Algal Overgrowth (if herbivores are removed).
    *   Coral Reef Health.

**Logic Description:** Overfishing is a major problem in the Mesoamerican Reef, depleting populations of important fish species and disrupting the food web.

### Stressor: Coastal Development

**Metric:** Area of coastline developed (km or ha); tourism intensity (number of visitors); infrastructure development (e.g., hotels, marinas).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Government statistics (tourism, construction).
    *   Remote sensing data.
    *   Reports from conservation organizations.

**Impact on Area:** Habitat loss (mangroves, seagrass beds); increased sedimentation and pollution.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of critical habitats (nursery grounds for fish).
    *   Reduced water quality.
    *   Physical damage to reefs (from anchors, construction).

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Tourism Development: Rapid growth in tourism in some areas.
    *   Population Growth: Increased demand for housing and infrastructure.
    *   Government Policies: Land-use planning and zoning.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Water Quality.
    *   Sedimentation.
    *   Habitat Loss.

**Logic Description:** Rapid coastal development, driven by tourism and population growth, is leading to habitat loss, increased sedimentation, and pollution, impacting coral reefs.

### Stressor: Water Pollution (from Land Runoff)

**Metric:** Concentrations of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus), sediments, and pesticides in coastal waters.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Water quality monitoring programs (often limited).
    *   Research studies.

**Impact on Area:** Reduced water quality.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Algal overgrowth, smothering corals.
    *   Reduced light penetration.
    *   Direct harm to corals and other organisms.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Agricultural Runoff: Fertilizers and pesticides from agriculture.
    *   Deforestation: Increased sediment runoff.
    *   Urban Runoff: Sewage and stormwater.
    *   Inadequate Wastewater Treatment.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Coral Reef Health.
    *   Algal Blooms.

**Logic Description:** Runoff from agriculture, deforestation, and urban areas carries pollutants (nutrients, sediments, pesticides) into coastal waters, degrading water quality and impacting coral reefs.

### Stressor: Climate Change (Mesoamerican Reef)

**Metric:** SST, Ocean Acidification, storm intensity.

**Data Sources:**
        * Climate models.
        * Oceanographic data.

**Impact on Area:** Coral Bleaching

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
        * Coral mortality.
        * Shifts in species
        * Acidification impacts.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
        * Global GHG emissions

**Influences (Stressors):**
    * Coral Bleaching
     * Ocean Acidification
     * Storm intensity

**Logic Description:**  Warming waters, acidification, and potentially stronger storms impact.

### Stressor: Invasive Species (Mesoamerican Reef)

**Metric:** Abundance and distribution of lionfish (and other invasive species, if relevant).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Underwater surveys.
    *   Research studies.
    *   Lionfish removal programs.

**Impact on Area:**  Indirect - affects the native fish populations.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Predation on native fish and invertebrates.
    *   Competition with native predators.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Introduction through the aquarium trade (likely initial introduction).
    *   Lack of Natural Predators: In the Caribbean.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Native Fish Populations.

**Logic Description:** The invasive lionfish, a voracious predator with no natural predators in the Atlantic/Caribbean, is a major threat to reef fish populations in the Mesoamerican Reef.
