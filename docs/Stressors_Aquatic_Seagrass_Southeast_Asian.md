## Southeast Asian Seagrass

### Stressor: Coastal Development

**Metric:** Area of seagrass habitat converted to other land uses (aquaculture, ports, urban development) (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote sensing data.
    *   Government statistics (various countries).
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** *Significant* loss of seagrass habitat; fragmentation.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of habitat for a wide range of species.
    *   Reduced nursery grounds for fish.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Aquaculture Expansion: Shrimp and fish farming.
    *   Urbanization and Population Growth.
    *   Infrastructure Development (ports, roads).

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Habitat Loss (the primary impact).
    *   Water Quality.

**Logic Description:** Coastal development, driven by aquaculture, urbanization, and infrastructure projects, is a major threat to seagrass meadows in Southeast Asia.

### Stressor: Water Pollution

**Metric:** Concentrations of nutrients, sediments, and other pollutants in coastal waters.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Water quality monitoring data (often limited).
    *   Research studies.

**Impact on Area:** Reduced water clarity; stress on seagrasses.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Reduced seagrass growth and survival.
    *   Algal blooms.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Agricultural Runoff.
    *   Urban Runoff.
    *   Industrial Discharge.
    *   Aquaculture Effluent.
    * Deforestation

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Light Availability.
    *   Seagrass Health.

**Logic Description:** Pollution from various sources degrades water quality and impacts seagrass meadows.

### Stressor: Destructive Fishing Practices

**Metric:** Use of bottom trawls, dynamite fishing, and other destructive methods.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Fisheries data (often unreliable).
    *   Reports from local communities and conservation organizations.
    *   Research studies.

**Impact on Area:** Direct physical damage to seagrass beds.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat destruction.
    *   Decline of fish populations.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Poverty and Lack of Alternative Livelihoods.
    *   Weak Enforcement of Fisheries Regulations.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Habitat Loss.

**Logic Description:** Destructive fishing practices, such as bottom trawling and dynamite fishing, damage seagrass beds and impact associated biodiversity.

### Stressor: Climate Change (Southeast Asian Seagrass)

**Metric:** Sea surface temperature; ocean acidification; sea level rise; storm intensity.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Climate models.
        * Oceanographic data.

**Impact on Area:** Seagrass die-offs; distribution changes

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
* Increased stress; species shifts.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
*   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Sea Level Rise.
    *   Ocean Acidification.

**Logic Description:** Climate change related impacts on seagrass.
