## Sonoran Desert

### Stressor: Urban Sprawl

**Metric:** Area converted to urban development (ha/year) (Phoenix, Tucson, etc.).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote sensing data.
    *   City and county planning documents.

**Impact on Area:** *Significant* habitat loss and fragmentation.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of habitat for iconic desert species (e.g., saguaro cactus, desert tortoise).
    *   Increased human-wildlife conflict.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Population Growth: Rapid population growth in cities like Phoenix and Tucson.
    *   Urban Expansion.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Habitat Fragmentation.

**Logic Description:** Urban sprawl, driven by rapid population growth in cities within and adjacent to the Sonoran Desert, is a *major* threat to habitat and biodiversity.

### Stressor: Water Extraction

**Metric:** Volume of groundwater extracted (mÂ³/year); changes in groundwater levels; impacts on springs.

**Data Sources:**
    *   USGS water resource data.
    *   Arizona Department of Water Resources data.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Depletion of groundwater; loss of water sources.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Impacts on riparian habitats and springs, which are crucial for many desert species.
    *   Increased stress on vegetation.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Urban Water Demand.
    *   Agricultural Water Use.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Water Availability.

**Logic Description:** Groundwater extraction for urban and agricultural use is a major concern, impacting water availability for desert ecosystems.

### Stressor: Border Infrastructure
**Metric:** Length and placement of border wall/fencing.

**Data Sources:**
 * Government records

**Impact on Area:** Fragmentation of habitat

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
 * Blocks movement and gene flow for wildlife.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
        * Political decisions

**Influences (Stressors):**
      * Wildlife movement

**Logic Description:** Construction along the US-Mexico border impacts.

### Stressor: Invasive Species

**Metric:** Distribution and abundance (e.g., buffelgrass).

**Data Sources:**
*   Vegetation surveys.
    *   Research studies.

**Impact on Area:** Changes in vegetation; increased fire risk.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
   * Competition with native plants
 * Altered fire

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
 * Disturbance
 * Climate Change

**Influences (Stressors):**
      * Fire regimes.
* Native plants

**Logic Description:** Invasive plants like buffelgrass are outcompeting natives and increasing fire risk.

---
### Stressor: Climate Change

**Metric:** Increased temperature; changes in precipitation.

**Data Sources:**
 * Climate models.
* Historical data.

**Impact on Area:** Increased aridity

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
       * Stress on species.
     * Shifts in distributions.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
  * Global GHG

**Influences (Stressors):**
    * Water availability
    * Fire regimes

**Logic Description:** Climate change impacts.
