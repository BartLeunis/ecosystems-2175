## Cold-Water Corals

### Stressor: Bottom Trawling

**Metric:** Area of cold-water coral habitats trawled; frequency of trawling; damage to coral structures.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Fisheries data (often incomplete).
    *   Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) data.
    *   Underwater surveys (using ROVs and submersibles).
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Severe physical destruction of coral structures; removal of habitat-forming species.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   High mortality of corals and associated organisms.
    *   Loss of biodiversity hotspots.
    *   Disruption of deep-sea food webs.
    *   Extremely slow recovery rates (centuries or millennia).

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Demand for Deep-Sea Fish: That may occur near coral habitats.
    *   Fishing Technology.
    *   Weak Governance and Enforcement.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Habitat Destruction (the overwhelming impact).

**Logic Description:** Bottom trawling is *by far* the greatest threat to cold-water coral ecosystems, causing severe and often irreversible damage to these slow-growing and fragile habitats.

### Stressor: Climate Change

**Metric:** Changes in water temperature, oxygen levels, and pH, currents.

**Data Sources:**
        * Oceanographic data
        * Climate Models

**Impact on Area:** Changes in environment

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
        * Possible range shifts
        * Physiological impacts.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
         * Global emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
       *  Ocean Acidification.

**Logic Description:** Climate change can impact cold water corals, though the extent is still being investigated.

### Stressor: Ocean Acidification

**Metric:** pH levels and carbonate saturation

**Data Sources:**
         * Oceanographic data
         * Models

**Impact on Area**: Reduced calcification rates

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
  * Coral skeleton weakening
   * Reduced growth

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
  * Atmospheric CO2

**Influences (Stressors):**
 * Coral health.

**Logic Description:**  Acidification hinders the ability to build skeletons.
