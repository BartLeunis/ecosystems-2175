## Abyssal Plains

### Stressor: Deep-Sea Mining (Polymetallic Nodules)

**Metric:** Area of abyssal plain licensed for exploration or exploitation (kmÂ²); density of polymetallic nodules; amount of sediment disturbed.

**Data Sources:**
    *   International Seabed Authority (ISA).
    *   National government data.
    *   Research publications.
    *   Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs).

**Impact on Area:** Removal of polymetallic nodules (which are a key habitat feature); creation of large sediment plumes.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of nodule-dwelling organisms (many of which are small and poorly known).
    *   Impacts on sediment-dwelling organisms (from sediment plumes and compaction).
    *   Potential for widespread and long-lasting impacts due to the slow recovery rates of abyssal ecosystems.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Demand for Metals: (e.g., manganese, nickel, cobalt, copper).
    *   Technological Advancements.
    *   International Regulations.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Habitat Destruction (primary impact).
    *   Water Quality (sediment plumes).

**Logic Description:** Mining for polymetallic nodules on the abyssal plains poses a significant threat, involving the removal of a key habitat feature and the creation of large sediment plumes, with potentially widespread and long-lasting impacts on the poorly understood biodiversity of this vast habitat.

### Stressor: Plastic Pollution (Abyssal Plains)

**Metric:** Concentrations of microplastics and macroplastics in abyssal sediments and water column.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Sampling of deep-sea sediments (using ROVs and coring devices).
    *   Research studies.

**Impact on Area:** Widespread contamination of the abyssal plain with plastic.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Ingestion of microplastics by abyssal organisms.
    *   Potential for toxic effects.
    *   Potential for plastic to act as a substrate for microbial colonization.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Land-Based Sources of Plastic Pollution.
    *   Ocean Currents: Transporting plastic to the deep sea.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Potential Impacts on Abyssal Food Webs.

**Logic Description:** Even the remote abyssal plains are accumulating plastic pollution, with potential, though poorly understood, impacts on the deep-sea ecosystem.

### Stressor: Climate Change (Abyssal Plains)

**Metric:** Changes in deep ocean temperature, currents, oxygen, pH, and food supply.

**Data Sources:**
 * Climate models
 * Oceanographic data.

**Impact on Area:** Changes to the physical and chemical environment.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
 * Potential shifts.
 * Changes in food supply.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
* Global emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
 * Ocean acidification.

**Logic Description:** Climate change impacts even the deep abyssal plain.
