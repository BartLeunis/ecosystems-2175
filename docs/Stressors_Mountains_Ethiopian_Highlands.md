**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Water Resources: Impacts on rainfall and water availability.
    *   Agricultural Productivity.
    *   Desertification (in some areas).

**Logic Description:** Climate change is impacting rainfall patterns and increasing temperatures in the Ethiopian Highlands, exacerbating existing pressures on water resources and agriculture, and potentially leading to increased drought and desertification.

### Stressor: Soil Erosion (Ethiopian Highlands)

**Metric:** Soil loss rate (tonnes/ha/year); gully formation; sediment load in rivers.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Field measurements (e.g., using erosion pins).
    *   Remote sensing data.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Loss of topsoil; reduced land productivity; sedimentation of rivers and reservoirs.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of soil fertility, impacting plant communities.
    *   Degradation of water quality.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Deforestation: Loss of vegetation cover leaves soil exposed.
    *   Overgrazing: Reduces vegetation cover.
    *   Intensive Agriculture: On steep slopes without proper soil conservation practices.
    *   Population Pressure: Leads to cultivation of marginal lands.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Agricultural Productivity: Reduces crop yields.
    *   Water Quality: Increased sediment load in rivers.
    *   Reservoir Siltation: Reduces the lifespan of reservoirs.

**Logic Description:** Soil erosion is a *severe* and widespread problem in the Ethiopian Highlands, driven by deforestation, overgrazing, intensive agriculture, and population pressure. This loss of topsoil reduces land productivity and impacts water quality.

### Stressor: Invasive Species

**Metric:** Distribution and abundance

**Data Sources:**
 * Field Surveys
 * Research

**Impact on Area:** Changes in plant communities.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
* Competition with native species.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    * Human activities.
    * Disturbance.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    * Native plant communities.

**Logic Description**: Invasive plants can impact.
