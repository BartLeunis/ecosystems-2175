## Canadian Boreal Forest

### Stressor: Infrastructure Development (Canadian Boreal Forest)

    *   Remote sensing.
    *   Industry reports.

**Impact on Area:** Habitat fragmentation; direct loss from resource extraction.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss and fragmentation.
    *   Disruption of corridors (caribou are particularly sensitive).
    *   Impacts on aquatic systems.
    *   Increased access for hunting/trapping.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Economic Growth: Demand for resources (timber, oil, minerals).
    *   Government Policies: Resource development plans.
    *   Global Commodity Prices.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Deforestation (localized around infrastructure).
    *   Wildfires (increased access).
    *   Pollution (from mining, oil sands).

**Logic Description:** Linear infrastructure (roads, pipelines) and resource extraction activities (mining, oil sands, forestry) fragment habitat and lead to direct habitat loss, with significant impacts on wildlife, particularly caribou.

### Stressor: Deforestation (Canadian Boreal Forest)

**Metric:** Area of forest cleared per year (ha/year) (often associated with logging and conversion to other land uses).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Canadian government data (National Forest Inventory).
    *   Remote sensing.

**Impact on Area:** Changes in forest age structure; localized forest loss.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss (especially for species requiring older forest).
    *   Changes in species composition.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Infrastructure Development (roads).
    *   Economic Growth: Demand for timber.
    *   Government Policies: Forestry regulations.

**Influences (Stressors):**
        * Carbon Storage and Sequestration

**Logic Description:** Logging is a major driver of deforestation, impacting forest age structure and biodiversity. Conversion to agriculture is less common than in some other forest types, but resource extraction (oil sands) can result in significant deforestation.

### Stressor: Temperature Increase (Canadian Boreal Forest)

**Metric:** Average annual temperature increase (°C) (warming is occurring at a faster rate at higher latitudes).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Climate models.
    *   Historical records.

**Impact on Area:** Indirect; thawing permafrost.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Shifts in species distributions (northward).
    *   Increased stress on boreal species.
    *   Changes in phenology.
    *   Increased pest/disease outbreaks (e.g., mountain pine beetle).
    *   Thawing permafrost impacts forest structure and hydrology.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Wildfires.
    *   Changes in Precipitation.
    *   Permafrost Thaw.
    * Pest outbreaks

**Logic Description:** Rapid warming is a major threat, leading to shifts in species distributions, increased pest outbreaks, and thawing permafrost, which has significant impacts on the ecosystem.

### Stressor: Changes in Precipitation (Canadian Boreal Forest)

**Metric:** Change in annual precipitation (mm/year); changes in snowpack; changes in seasonality.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Climate models.
    *   Historical records.

**Impact on Area:** Indirect; changes in water availability and permafrost.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Changes in species composition.
    *   Altered streamflow.
    *   Increased drought stress (in some areas).
    *   Changes in wetland extent.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Wildfires.
     * Permafrost Thaw
     * Water availability

**Logic Description:** Changes in precipitation patterns, including changes in snowpack and the timing of precipitation, impact water availability and ecosystem processes.

### Stressor: Wildfires (Canadian Boreal Forest)

**Metric:** Number of fires; area burned (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Canadian government data (Canadian Wildland Fire Information System).
    *   Remote sensing.

**Impact on Area:** Direct loss of forest area; changes in forest structure and age.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Mortality.
    *   Habitat loss.
    *   Changes in species composition (favoring fire-adapted species).
     * Large carbon emissions

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Temperature Increase (longer fire season, drier conditions).
    *   Changes in Precipitation (drought).
    *   Insect outbreaks (creating dead trees).
    *   Lightning strikes (natural ignition source).
    *  Human Activities

**Influences (Stressors):**
     * Air Quality
    * Future Fire Risk
     * Carbon cycle

**Logic Description:** Wildfires are a natural part of the boreal ecosystem, but their frequency and intensity are increasing due to climate change, leading to significant impacts on forest structure, biodiversity, and the carbon cycle.

### Stressor: Permafrost Thaw (Canadian Boreal Forest)

**Metric:** Active layer thickness (depth of soil that thaws each summer) (cm); area of permafrost degradation (ha).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Field measurements.
    *   Remote sensing (e.g., measuring ground subsidence).
    *   Climate models.
