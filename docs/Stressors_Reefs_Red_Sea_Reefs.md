## Caribbean Reefs

### Stressor: Overfishing

**Metric:** Fish biomass, size structure, and abundance of key species (e.g., groupers, snappers, parrotfish).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Fisheries data (often limited and unreliable).
    *   Underwater surveys (conducted by research organizations and conservation groups).
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Not directly applicable, but affects ecosystem structure.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Decline of important fish species, especially large predators and herbivores.
    *   Disruption of the food web (e.g., loss of herbivores can lead to algal overgrowth).
    *   Loss of top predators.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   High Fishing Pressure: Due to local dependence on fishing and tourism.
    *   Weak Enforcement of Fisheries Regulations.
    *   Lack of Alternative Livelihoods.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Algal Overgrowth (if herbivores are removed).
    *   Coral Reef Health.

**Logic Description:** Overfishing is a widespread and chronic problem across the Caribbean, depleting populations of important reef fish and disrupting the ecological balance of reef ecosystems. This is often a *more* severe problem than in, say, the Great Barrier Reef.

### Stressor: Water Pollution (from Land Runoff)

**Metric:** Concentrations of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus), sediments, and other pollutants in coastal waters.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Water quality monitoring programs (often limited).
    *   Research studies.

**Impact on Area:** Reduced water quality; increased turbidity.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Algal overgrowth, smothering corals.
    *   Reduced light penetration.
    *   Direct harm to corals and other organisms.
    *   Increased susceptibility to disease.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Agricultural Runoff: Fertilizers and pesticides.
    *   Deforestation: Increased sediment runoff.
    *   Urban Runoff: Sewage, stormwater, and industrial effluent.
    *   Inadequate Wastewater Treatment: Common in many Caribbean islands.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Coral Reef Health.
    *   Algal Blooms.
    *   Coral Disease.

**Logic Description:** Pollution from various sources (agriculture, deforestation, urban runoff, and inadequate wastewater treatment) degrades water quality and impacts coral reefs throughout the Caribbean.

### Stressor: Coastal Development

**Metric:** Area of coastline developed; tourism intensity (number of visitors); infrastructure development.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Government statistics.
    *   Remote sensing data.
    *   Reports from conservation organizations.

**Impact on Area:** Habitat loss (mangroves, seagrass beds); increased sedimentation and pollution.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of critical habitats (nursery grounds for fish).
    *   Reduced water quality.
    *   Physical damage to reefs (construction, anchors).

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Tourism Development: A major driver in many Caribbean islands.
    *   Population Growth.
    *   Lack of Effective Coastal Zone Management.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Water Quality.
    *   Sedimentation.
    *   Habitat Loss.

**Logic Description:** Rapid coastal development, often driven by tourism, is leading to habitat loss, increased sedimentation, and pollution, impacting coral reefs across the Caribbean.

### Stressor: Coral Disease

**Metric:** Prevalence and severity of coral diseases (e.g., white band disease, black band disease, stony coral tissue loss disease).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Underwater surveys.
    *   Research studies.

**Impact on Area:** Coral mortality; changes in coral community structure.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Significant coral mortality (especially for key reef-building species).
    *   Loss of coral cover.
    *   Shifts in coral species composition.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Water Pollution: Can increase coral susceptibility to disease.
    *   Ocean Warming: Can exacerbate disease outbreaks.
    *   Other Stressors: That weaken corals.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Coral Cover.
    *   Reef Resilience.

**Logic Description:** Coral diseases have caused widespread and devastating coral mortality throughout the Caribbean, contributing significantly to the overall decline of reef ecosystems.

### Stressor: Invasive Species (Lionfish)

**Metric:** Abundance and distribution of lionfish.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Underwater surveys.
    *   Lionfish removal programs.
    *   Research studies.

**Impact on Area:** Primarily affects fish populations (indirect impact on area).

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Predation on native fish and invertebrates.
    *   Competition with native predators.
    *   Significant reduction in recruitment of native fish.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Introduction through the aquarium trade (likely initial introduction).
    *   Lack of Natural Predators: In the Caribbean.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Native Fish Populations.
    *   Reef Ecosystem Structure.

**Logic Description:** The invasive lionfish, a voracious predator with no natural predators in the Caribbean, is a significant threat to native reef fish populations and the overall health of Caribbean reefs.

### Stressor: Climate Change

**Metric:** SST; Ocean acidification; hurricane frequency and intensity.

**Data Sources:**
 * Climate Models.
 * Oceanographic data.

**Impact on Area:** Coral Bleaching; reduced calcification

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
 * Coral mortality
* Species shifts
* Acidification.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
* Global emissions

**Influences (Stressors):**
* Bleaching, Acidification, Storm damage.

**Logic Description:**  Warming, acidification, and potentially stronger storms all have negative effects.
