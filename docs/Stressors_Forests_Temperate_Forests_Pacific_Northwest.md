## Pacific Northwest Forests (USA/Canada)

### Stressor: Infrastructure Development (Pacific Northwest Forests)

**Metric:** Road density (km/km²); area affected by logging, dams (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   US Forest Service and Canadian government data.
    *   Remote sensing.

**Impact on Area:** Habitat fragmentation.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss and fragmentation.
    *   Disruption of corridors.
    *   Impacts on aquatic ecosystems from dams.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Economic Growth: Resource extraction (timber).
    *   Population Growth.
    *   Government Policies.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Deforestation (primarily through logging).
    *   Water quality (dams)

**Logic Description:** Infrastructure, primarily related to logging and dams, fragments habitat and impacts aquatic ecosystems.

### Stressor: Deforestation (Pacific Northwest Forests)

**Metric:** Area of forest cleared per year (ha/year) (often related to logging, but can also include conversion to other land uses).

**Data Sources:**
    *   US Forest Service and Canadian government data.
    *   Remote sensing.

**Impact on Area:** Loss of old-growth forest; changes in forest age structure.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss (especially for old-growth dependent species).
    *   Changes in species composition.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Infrastructure Development (roads).
    *   Economic Growth: Demand for timber.
    *   Government Policies: Timber harvest regulations.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *  Carbon Sequestration

**Logic Description:** Logging, particularly of old-growth forests, is a major driver of deforestation, impacting biodiversity and carbon storage.

### Stressor: Temperature Increase (Pacific Northwest Forests)

**Metric:** Average annual temperature increase (°C).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Climate models.
    *   Historical records.

**Impact on Area:** Indirect.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Species shifts.
    *   Increased stress.
    *   Changes in phenology.
    *   Increased pest/disease outbreaks (e.g., mountain pine beetle).

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Wildfires.
    *   Changes in Precipitation.
    *   Pest outbreaks

**Logic Description:** Climate change impacts, including increased risk of wildfires and insect outbreaks.

### Stressor: Changes in Precipitation (Pacific Northwest Forests)

**Metric:** Change in annual precipitation (mm/year); changes in snowpack (snow water equivalent - SWE).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Climate models.
    *   Historical records.

**Impact on Area:** Indirect; changes in water availability.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Changes in species composition.
    *   Altered streamflow.
    *   Increased drought stress (in some areas).
    * Reduced snowpack impacts summer water availability

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Wildfires.
    * Water availability

**Logic Description:** Changes in precipitation patterns, including reduced snowpack, impact water availability and species composition.

### Stressor: Wildfires (Pacific Northwest Forests)

**Metric:** Number of fires; area burned (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   US Forest Service and Canadian government data.
    *   Remote sensing.

**Impact on Area:** Direct loss of forest area; changes in forest structure.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Mortality.
    *   Habitat loss.
    *   Changes in species composition.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Temperature Increase.
    *   Changes in Precipitation (reduced snowpack, longer dry seasons).
    *   Forest Management Practices (fire suppression).
    *   Insect outbreaks (creating dead trees).

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Future fire risk
    * air quality

**Logic Description:** Wildfires, increasing in frequency and intensity due to climate change and past fire suppression, are a major threat.

### Stressor: Invasive Species (Pacific Northwest Forests)

**Metric:** Abundance/distribution of key invasives (e.g., Scotch broom, Himalayan blackberry).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Forest health monitoring programs.
    *   Research studies.

**Impact on Area:** Changes in forest composition and structure.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Competition with native plants.
    *   Altered ecosystem processes.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
     * Disturbance (e.g., logging, roads).
    * Climate Change
    * Global trade

**Influences (Stressors):**
     * Native plant communities

**Logic Description:** Invasive plants can outcompete native species, altering forest structure and function.
