## Camargue (France)

### Stressor: Altered Hydrology (Camargue)

**Metric:** Water levels in the Rhone River and in the Camargue's lagoons and marshes; salinity levels; water flow rates.

**Data Sources:**
    *   French government agencies (e.g., Agence de l'eau Rhône Méditerranée Corse).
    *   Research institutions (e.g., Tour du Valat research center).
    *   Remote sensing data.

**Impact on Area:** Changes in the extent and distribution of different wetland habitats (freshwater marshes, brackish lagoons, salt marshes).

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Impacts on bird populations (breeding, feeding, migration - the Camargue is a *major* bird area).
    *   Changes in plant communities (due to altered salinity).
    *   Impacts on fish and invertebrate communities.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Water Management Practices: The Camargue is heavily managed for water, with a complex system of canals, sluices, and pumping stations.
    *   Upstream Water Use: Agriculture, industry, and urban areas along the Rhone River.
    *   Rice Cultivation: A major water user within the Camargue itself.
    *   Climate Change: Changes in precipitation and sea level.
    * Sea level rise

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Salinity Levels.
    *   Habitat Availability.
    *   Water Quality.

**Logic Description:** The Camargue's hydrology is heavily managed, and changes in water management practices, upstream water use, and climate change can significantly alter water levels, salinity, and the distribution of different wetland habitats. This is a constant balancing act between human needs and ecological needs.

### Stressor: Pollution (Camargue)

**Metric:** Concentrations of pollutants (e.g., nutrients, pesticides, heavy metals) in water, sediment, and biota.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Water quality monitoring programs (French government agencies, research institutions).
    *   Research studies.

**Impact on Area:** Degradation of water quality.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Eutrophication (nutrient enrichment).
    *   Toxic effects on wildlife.
    *   Impacts on food webs.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Agricultural Runoff: From rice cultivation and other agriculture in the region.
    *   Industrial Discharge: (potentially, from industries upstream).
    *   Urban Runoff: From nearby towns and cities.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Water Quality.
    *   Wildlife Health.

**Logic Description:** Pollution from agriculture, industry, and urban areas can degrade water quality and impact the Camargue's ecosystems.

### Stressor: Climate Change (Camargue)

**Metric:** Temperature increase (°C); changes in precipitation (mm/year, seasonality); sea level rise (mm/year).

**Data Sources:**
  *  Climate Models
    * Historical Records

**Impact on Area:**
    *   Coastal erosion and inundation due to sea level rise.
    *   Changes in salinity.
    *   Increased risk of drought.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Shifts in species distributions.
    *   Increased stress on wildlife.
    *   Changes in phenology.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    * Global GHG

**Influences (Stressors):**
     * Sea Level Rise
      * Hydrology

**Logic Description:** Climate change is impacting the Camargue through sea level rise, altered precipitation patterns, and increased temperatures.

### Stressor: Invasive Species

**Metric:** Distribution and abundance

**Data Sources:**
      * Research and monitoring

**Impact on Area**: Ecosystem changes

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
     * Competition, altered habitats

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
     * Human activities

**Influences (Stressors):**
     * Native species

**Logic Description:** Invasive species can disrupt the ecosystem.

---
### Stressor: Tourism
**Metric**: Number of visitors

**Data Sources:**
  * Tourism Statistics

**Impact on Area**: Localized disturbance

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
 * Disturbance of wildlife, especially birds.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
  * Popularity of the region

**Influences (Stressors):**
 * Wildlife Behavior

**Logic Description:** Tourism, while economically important, can disturb wildlife.
