## Great Barrier Reef

### Stressor: Ocean Warming

**Metric:** Sea surface temperature (SST) (°C); frequency and severity of marine heatwaves; Degree Heating Weeks (DHW).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) Long-Term Monitoring Program.
    *   Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) reports.
    *   NOAA Coral Reef Watch.
    *   Bureau of Meteorology (Australia) data.

**Impact on Area:** Coral bleaching; reduced coral growth rates.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Coral mortality (severe and frequent bleaching events).
    *   Shifts in coral species composition.
    *   Impacts on fish and invertebrate communities.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Coral Bleaching.
    *   Disease Outbreaks.

**Logic Description:** Ocean warming is the *most significant* threat to the GBR, causing widespread and increasingly frequent coral bleaching events.

### Stressor: Ocean Acidification

**Metric:** Ocean pH; aragonite saturation state (Ωar).

**Data Sources:**
    *   AIMS monitoring data.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Reduced calcification rates.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Slower coral growth.
    *   Weaker coral skeletons.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Increased Atmospheric CO2.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Coral growth and survival.

**Logic Description:** Ocean acidification reduces the ability of corals to build their skeletons.

### Stressor: Water Pollution (from Land Runoff)

**Metric:** Concentrations of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus), sediments, and pesticides in coastal waters.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Queensland Government water quality monitoring programs.
    *   AIMS monitoring data.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Reduced water quality; increased turbidity.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Algal overgrowth.
    *   Reduced light penetration.
    *   Direct harm to corals and other organisms.
    * Exacerbates Crown-of-thorns Starfish outbreaks

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Agricultural Runoff (sugarcane and cattle grazing are major sources).
    *   Coastal Development.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Crown-of-Thorns Starfish Outbreaks.
    *   Coral Bleaching (reduces resilience).

**Logic Description:** Runoff from agriculture and coastal development carries nutrients, sediments, and pollutants into coastal waters, degrading water quality and impacting coral health.  This is a *major* and well-documented stressor on the GBR.

### Stressor: Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) Outbreaks

**Metric:** Density of COTS (number per hectare).

**Data Sources:**
    *   AIMS Long-Term Monitoring Program.
    *   GBRMPA reports.

**Impact on Area:** Direct predation on corals.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Significant coral mortality during outbreaks.
    *   Changes in reef structure.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Nutrient Enrichment (from land runoff - promotes larval survival).
    *   Overfishing (removal of COTS predators - less well-established).

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Coral Cover.

**Logic Description:** Outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS), a coral-eating starfish, are a major cause of coral decline on the GBR.  These outbreaks are thought to be linked to nutrient enrichment from land runoff.

### Stressor: Tropical Cyclones

**Metric:** Frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones (categories 3-5).

**Data Sources:**
   * Bureau of Meteorology (Australia) data
    * Historical records.

**Impact on Area:** Physical damage of coral reefs

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
 * Coral Mortality
 * Loss of Reef Structure

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    * Climate change
   * Sea Surface Temperature

**Influences (Stressors):**
 * Reef Structure

**Logic Description:** Strong cyclones can cause significant physical damage to the reef structure.

### Stressor: Overfishing

**Metric**: Fish biomass, size, catch per unit

**Data Sources:**
        * Fisheries data
        * Underwater surveys

**Impact on Area:** N/A

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
  * Loss of species, trophic structure

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
        * Fishing pressure.

**Influences (Stressors):**
 * Food web.

**Logic Description:** Overfishing can impact, although it's more regulated here than other areas.
