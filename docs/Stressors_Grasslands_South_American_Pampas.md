## South American Pampas

### Stressor: Land-Use Change (South American Pampas)

**Metric:** Area converted to agriculture (especially soybeans), pasture, or other land uses (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote sensing data.
    *   Government statistics (Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay).
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Massive loss of pampas habitat; fragmentation.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss and fragmentation.
    *   Decline of pampas-dependent species.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   South American Pampas - Agricultural Expansion: Demand for soybeans and other crops, and for cattle pasture.
    *   South American Pampas - Global Commodity Prices.
    *   South American Pampas - Government Policies.

**Influences (Stressors):**
        *  South American Pampas - Habitat Fragmentation

**Logic Description:** Conversion of pampas to agriculture (especially soybean cultivation) and pasture is the dominant stressor, leading to massive habitat loss.

### Stressor: Habitat Fragmentation (South American Pampas)

**Metric:** Patch size distribution; edge density; connectivity indices.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Land cover data.
    *   GIS analysis.

**Impact on Area:** Remaining pampas exists in small, isolated patches.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
     * Reduced gene flow.
    *   Increased edge effects.
   * Limited Dispersal
    * Increased vulnerability.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
  *  South American Pampas - Land Use Change

**Influences (Stressors):**
 * Exacerbates other stressor impacts

**Logic Description:** Fragmentation isolates pampas patches, reducing their ecological viability.

### Stressor: Climate Change (South American Pampas)

**Metric:** Temperature increase; changes in precipitation; drought frequency/severity.
**Data Sources:**

 * Climate models.
 * Historical records

**Impact on Area:** Indirect - changes in growing conditions.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
        * Shifts in species distributions.
        * Increased stress.
        * Changes in phenology.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
       * Global GHG

**Influences (Stressors):**
     *  South American Pampas - Water Availability

**Logic Description:** Climate change alters temperature and precipitation patterns.

### Stressor: Overgrazing (South American Pampas)

**Metric:** Livestock density; vegetation cover and composition.

**Data Sources:**
 * Agricultural statistics.
* Vegetation Surveys

**Impact on Area:** Changes in vegetation structure; soil erosion.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
  * Loss of palatable species
 * Soil compaction
 * Spread of invasives.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
        *  South American Pampas - Livestock Management Practices.

**Influences (Stressors):**
 *  South American Pampas - Vegetation Changes

**Logic Description:** Overgrazing by livestock can degrade pampas vegetation.

---
### Stressor: Invasive Species (South American Pampas)

**Metric:** Abundance/Distribution of key invasive species (e.g., certain grasses).

**Data Sources:**
        * Vegetation surveys.
        * Research.

**Impact on Area:** Changes in vegetation composition.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
 * Competition.
 * Altered processes.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
 *  South American Pampas - Disturbance
 *  South American Pampas - Climate Change

**Influences (Stressors):**
   *  South American Pampas - Native Plant Communities

**Logic Description:** Invasive grasses can outcompete native pampas species.
