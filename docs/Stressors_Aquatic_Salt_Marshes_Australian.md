## Australian Salt Marshes

### Stressor: Sea Level Rise

**Metric:** Rate of sea level rise (mm/year); marsh elevation; accretion rates.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Tide gauge records.
    *   Satellite altimetry.
    *   Research publications (CSIRO).
    *   Australian Bureau of Meteorology

**Impact on Area:** Inundation; erosion; potential for landward migration (in some areas).

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss.
    *   Species shifts.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Coastal Erosion.
    *   Habitat Loss.

**Logic Description:** Sea level rise is a growing threat to Australian salt marshes.

### Stressor: Coastal Development
**Metric:** Area converted, Length of hardened shoreline

**Data Sources:**
    * Remote sensing
    * Government

**Impact on Area:** Direct loss and fragmentation of habitat.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
   * Habitat loss

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    * Urban Expansion
   * Infrastructure

**Influences (Stressors):**
    * Habitat loss
     * Coastal squeeze

**Logic Description:** Coastal development removes marsh habitat and restricts landward migration.

### Stressor: Altered Hydrology

**Metric:** Changes in freshwater inflow; presence of drainage structures.

**Data Sources:**
        * Water management records.
       * Research.

**Impact on Area:**
    *   Changes in salinity.
   * Altered sedimentation.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
        * Shifts in plant communities.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
         * Drainage and Flood Mitigation.
         * Upstream Water Use.

**Influences (Stressors):**
        * Salinity.
       * Sedimentation.

**Logic Description:** Alterations to freshwater inflow and drainage patterns impact marsh ecosystems.
