## Appalachian Forests (USA)

### Stressor: Infrastructure Development (Appalachian Forests)

**Metric:** Road density (km/km²); area affected by mining, energy development (e.g., fracking) (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   US Forest Service data.
    *   State and federal transportation agencies.
    *   Energy Information Administration (EIA).
    *   Remote sensing data.

**Impact on Area:** Habitat fragmentation; direct loss due to mining and energy infrastructure.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss and fragmentation.
    *   Disruption of ecological corridors.
    *   Water pollution from mining and energy development.
    *   Increased edge effects

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Economic Growth: Demand for energy and resources.
    *   Population Growth (in some areas).
    *   Government Policies: Energy policy, transportation planning.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Deforestation (though often localized around infrastructure).
    *   Water Pollution.
    *   Air pollution

**Logic Description:** Infrastructure, including roads and energy development (mining, fracking), fragments habitat and leads to direct habitat loss, impacting biodiversity.

### Stressor: Deforestation (Appalachian Forests)

**Metric:** Area of forest cleared per year (ha/year) (although net forest loss may be low or even negative in some areas due to regrowth, *localized* deforestation is still a stressor).

**Data Sources:**
    *   US Forest Service data (Forest Inventory and Analysis - FIA).
    *   Remote sensing data.

**Impact on Area:** Localized forest loss; changes in forest age structure.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss (especially for species requiring mature forest).
    *   Changes in species composition.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Infrastructure Development.
    *   Urban Sprawl.
    *   Agricultural Expansion (limited in some areas).
    *   Timber Harvesting (depending on management practices).

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Changes in forest age and structure affecting biodiversity

**Logic Description:** While overall forest cover in the Appalachians may be stable or even increasing in some areas due to reforestation, *localized* deforestation due to development, agriculture, and unsustainable timber harvesting continues to be a stressor, impacting habitat quality and biodiversity.

### Stressor: Temperature Increase (Appalachian Forests)

**Metric:** Average annual temperature increase (°C).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Global and regional climate models.
    *   Historical temperature records.

**Impact on Area:** Indirect.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Shifts in species distributions (northward and upslope).
    *   Increased physiological stress.
    *   Changes in phenology (timing of biological events).
    *   Increased susceptibility to pests and diseases.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Changes in Precipitation.
    *   Increased pest and pathogen outbreaks.

**Logic Description:** Climate change leads to warming temperatures, impacting species distributions, physiology, and increasing vulnerability to other stressors.

### Stressor: Changes in Precipitation (Appalachian Forests)

**Metric:** Change in annual precipitation (mm/year); changes in seasonality (e.g., more intense rainfall events, longer dry periods).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Climate models.
    *   Historical weather records.

**Impact on Area:** Indirect.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Changes in species composition (favoring drought-tolerant or flood-tolerant species).
    *   Altered streamflow regimes.
    *   Increased risk of drought stress in some areas.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Water quality in streams

**Logic Description:** Climate change alters precipitation patterns, leading to shifts in species composition and impacting water resources.

### Stressor: Invasive Species (Appalachian Forests)

**Metric:** Abundance and distribution of key invasive species (e.g., emerald ash borer, hemlock woolly adelgid, gypsy moth, garlic mustard).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Forest health monitoring programs (US Forest Service, state agencies).
    *   Research studies.

**Impact on Area:** Changes in forest composition and structure (loss of key tree species).

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Decline of native tree species.
    *   Cascading effects on other species that depend on those trees.
    *   Altered ecosystem processes (e.g., nutrient cycling).

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Trade and Travel (introduction of new species).
    *   Climate Change (may favor some invasive species).
    *   Disturbance (e.g., logging, which can create opportunities for invasives).

**Influences (Stressors):**
      * Forest Composition and structure

**Logic Description:** Invasive species, often introduced through human activities, can cause significant damage to forests, leading to the decline of native species and altering ecosystem function. Climate change may exacerbate the impacts of some invasives.

### Stressor: Air Pollution (Appalachian Forests)

**Metric:** Concentrations of pollutants (e.g., ozone, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide) (parts per billion - ppb, micrograms per cubic meter - µg/m³).

**Data Sources:**
        * EPA Air Quality System (AQS).
        * National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP).

**Impact on Area:** Reduced forest health and productivity.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Damage to foliage, reducing photosynthesis.
    *    Increased susceptibility to pests and diseases.
    *   Acidification of soils and water bodies, impacting aquatic life.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Industrial Activity.
    *   Fossil Fuel Combustion (power plants, vehicles).
    *   Agricultural Practices (fertilizer use).

**Influences (Stressors):**
     * Water Quality
     * Forest Health

**Logic Description:** Air pollution, from industrial activity and fossil fuel combustion, damages trees, reduces forest productivity, and can acidify soils and water.
