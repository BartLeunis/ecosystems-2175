## European Temperate Forests

### Stressor: Infrastructure Development (European Temperate Forests)

**Metric:** Road density (km/km²); area affected by development (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   European Environment Agency (EEA) data.
    *   National government statistics.
    *   Remote sensing.

**Impact on Area:** Habitat fragmentation (historically high levels of fragmentation).

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss and fragmentation.
    *   Disruption of corridors.
    *   Increased edge effects.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Economic Growth.
    *   Population Growth (and density).
    *   Transportation planning.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Deforestation (localized).
    * Increased Access

**Logic Description:** Continued development further fragments an already highly fragmented landscape.

### Stressor: Deforestation (European Temperate Forests)

**Metric:** Area of forest cleared per year (ha/year) (often localized; overall forest cover may be increasing in some areas due to afforestation, but *loss* of *old-growth* or *natural* forest is still a concern).

**Data Sources:**
    *   EEA data.
    *   National forest inventories.
    *   Remote sensing.

**Impact on Area:** Localized forest loss; changes in forest age structure.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss (especially for old-growth dependent species).
    *   Changes in species composition.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Infrastructure Development.
    *   Urban Sprawl.
    *   Agricultural Expansion (limited, but can occur).
    *   Timber Harvesting (depending on management practices).

**Influences (Stressors):**
        * Forest Age and Structure

**Logic Description:** While overall forest cover may be stable or increasing in some areas, localized deforestation and loss of old-growth forest continue to be stressors.

### Stressor: Temperature Increase (European Temperate Forests)

**Metric:** Average annual temperature increase (°C).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Climate models.
    *   Historical records.

**Impact on Area:** Indirect.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Species shifts (northward and upslope).
    *   Increased stress.
    *   Changes in phenology.
    *   Increased pest/disease outbreaks.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Wildfires.
    *   Changes in Precipitation.
    * Pest and disease outbreaks

**Logic Description:** Climate change impacts, including increased risk of drought and insect outbreaks.

### Stressor: Changes in Precipitation (European Temperate Forests)

**Metric:** Change in annual precipitation (mm/year); changes in seasonality (e.g., drier summers, wetter winters).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Climate models.
    *   Historical records.

**Impact on Area:** Indirect; changes in water availability.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Changes in species composition.
    *   Altered streamflow.
    *   Increased drought stress (in some areas).

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
      * Wildfires (in drier regions)
      * Water availability

**Logic Description:** Changes in precipitation patterns, including increased drought risk in some regions, impact water availability and species composition.

### Stressor: Wildfires (European Temperate Forests)

**Metric:** Number of fires; area burned (ha/year) (more significant in southern Europe).

**Data Sources:**
    *   EEA data.
    *   National fire statistics.
    *   Remote sensing.

**Impact on Area:** Direct loss of forest area (especially in Mediterranean regions).

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Mortality.
    *   Habitat loss.
    *   Changes in species composition.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Temperature Increase.
    *   Changes in Precipitation (drier summers).
    *   Land Abandonment (leading to fuel buildup).
    *   Human Activities (negligence, arson).

**Influences (Stressors):**
     * Air quality
     * Future Fire Risk

**Logic Description:** Wildfires, particularly in southern Europe, are increasing due to climate change and land management practices.

### Stressor: Air Pollution (European Temperate Forests)

**Metric:** Concentrations of pollutants (e.g., ozone, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide).

**Data Sources:**
    *   EEA air quality data.
    *   National monitoring networks.

**Impact on Area:** Reduced forest health and productivity.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Damage to foliage.
    *   Increased susceptibility to pests/diseases.
    *   Acidification of soils and water.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Industrial Activity.
    *   Fossil Fuel Combustion.
    *   Agricultural Practices.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    * Water Quality
    * Forest health

**Logic Description:** Air pollution, from various sources, continues to be a stressor, particularly in industrialized areas.
