## Australian Deserts

### Stressor: Invasive Species (Australian Deserts)

**Metric:** Abundance and distribution of key invasive species (e.g., feral camels, rabbits, cats, foxes, buffel grass).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Government reports (Australian Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment).
    *   Research publications.
    *   Wildlife surveys.

**Impact on Area:** Changes in vegetation composition; increased grazing pressure; increased predation pressure.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Feral camels: Damage vegetation and compete with native herbivores for water.
    *   Rabbits: Overgraze vegetation, contributing to soil erosion.
    *   Cats and foxes: Predation on native mammals, birds, and reptiles.
    *   Buffel grass: Outcompetes native grasses and increases fire intensity.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Historical Introductions: Many invasive species were introduced intentionally or accidentally.
    *   Lack of Natural Predators or Competitors.
    *   Disturbance: Overgrazing, land clearing, and altered fire regimes can create opportunities for invasives.
    * Climate Change

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Native Species Populations: A *major* impact.
    *   Fire Regimes: (e.g., buffel grass).
    *   Ecosystem Functioning.

**Logic Description:** Invasive species are a *major* threat to the biodiversity of Australian deserts. Feral animals (camels, rabbits, cats, foxes) and invasive plants (e.g., buffel grass) have had devastating impacts on native species and ecosystems.

### Stressor: Altered Fire Regimes (Australian Deserts)

**Metric:** Fire frequency; fire intensity; area burned; seasonality of fires.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote sensing data (fire scars).
    *   Historical fire records.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Changes in vegetation structure and composition.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Some native species are adapted to specific fire regimes, and changes can be detrimental.
    *   Increased fire frequency and intensity (often linked to invasive grasses) can lead to loss of fire-sensitive species.
    *   Changes in habitat structure.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Invasive Grasses: (e.g., buffel grass) can increase fuel loads and fire intensity.
    *   Climate Change: Hotter, drier conditions increase fire risk.
    *   Changes in Indigenous Land Management Practices: Traditional burning practices played an important role in shaping Australian ecosystems.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Vegetation Structure.
    *   Biodiversity.

**Logic Description:** Changes in fire regimes, often driven by invasive grasses and climate change, can have significant impacts on Australian desert ecosystems.

### Stressor: Climate Change (Australian Deserts)

**Metric:** Temperature increase; changes in rainfall; increased frequency/severity of drought.

**Data Sources:**
        * Climate Models
         * Historical data

**Impact on Area:** Increased aridity.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
 * Increased stress.
  * Species shifts

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
   * Global GHG

**Influences (Stressors):**
    * Water availability
    * Fire regimes

**Logic Description:** Climate change impacts.

### Stressor: Overgrazing
**Metric:** Livestock and feral herbivore density.

**Data Sources:**
 * Government statistics.
  * Research.

**Impact on Area:** Vegetation and soil degradation.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
* Impacts on native plant communities.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
 * Land management practices

**Influences (Stressors):**
       * Desertification.

**Logic Description:** Overgrazing impacts.
