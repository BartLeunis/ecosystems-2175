## Arabian Desert

### Stressor: Climate Change (Arabian Desert)

**Metric:** Temperature increase (°C); changes in precipitation (mm/year); increased frequency/severity of drought and heatwaves.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Climate models.
    *   Historical weather records (sparse).
    *   Remote sensing.

**Impact on Area:**  Further aridification; increased stress on water resources.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Increased stress on desert-adapted species.
    *   Potential for local extinctions.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Water Availability.

**Logic Description:** Climate change is exacerbating the already extreme conditions of the Arabian Desert.

### Stressor: Water Extraction (Arabian Desert)

**Metric:** Volume of groundwater extracted (m³/year); changes in groundwater levels.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Governmental water resource agencies (data may be limited).
    *   Research studies.

**Impact on Area:** *Critical* depletion of groundwater resources; loss of oases.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of water sources for wildlife.
    *   Decline of vegetation.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Agricultural Expansion: *Heavy* reliance on groundwater for irrigation.
    *   Population Growth: Increased demand for water.
    *   Industrial Use.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Water Availability:  A *critical* limiting factor.

**Logic Description:** Groundwater extraction, primarily for agriculture, is a *major* threat to water resources in the Arabian Desert, impacting both human populations and the limited biodiversity.

### Stressor: Oil and Gas Extraction (Arabian Desert)

**Metric:** Area affected by oil and gas exploration and production (ha); number of oil spills; pollution levels.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Industry reports.
    *   Government data (may be limited).
    *   Remote sensing.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Habitat loss and fragmentation; pollution.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Direct habitat destruction.
    *   Toxic effects of oil spills and pollution.
    *   Disturbance from noise and activity.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Demand for Oil and Gas.
    *   Government Policies.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Pollution.
    *   Habitat Loss.

**Logic Description:** Oil and gas extraction is a *major* industry in the Arabian Desert, leading to habitat loss, fragmentation, and pollution, impacting biodiversity.

### Stressor: Overgrazing

**Metric:** Livestock density

**Data Sources:**
  * Agricultural data

**Impact on Area:** Soil and vegetation degradation

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
 * Impacts on native plant communities.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
   * Livestock management.

**Influences (Stressors):**
        * Desertification

**Logic Description:** Overgrazing impacts vegetation.
