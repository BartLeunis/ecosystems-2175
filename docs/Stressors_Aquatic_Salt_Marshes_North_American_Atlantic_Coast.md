## North American Atlantic Coast Salt Marshes

### Stressor: Sea Level Rise

**Metric:** Rate of sea level rise (mm/year); marsh elevation relative to sea level; rate of vertical accretion; frequency/duration of inundation.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Tide gauge records (NOAA).
    *   Satellite altimetry (NASA, ESA).
    *   Sediment Elevation Tables (SETs).
    *   USGS data.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:**
    *   Inundation and submergence of low-lying marshes.
    *   Landward migration (where possible).
    *   Increased erosion.
    *   "Coastal squeeze" where migration is blocked.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of habitat for marsh-dependent species.
    *   Shifts in plant communities (towards more salt-tolerant species).
    *   Reduced nesting success for birds (e.g., Saltmarsh Sparrow).

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.
    *   Local Subsidence: In some areas.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Coastal Erosion.
    *   Habitat Loss (the dominant impact).

**Logic Description:** Sea level rise is a *critical* threat. Many areas are experiencing high rates of *relative* sea level rise (global rise + local subsidence). "Coastal squeeze" is a major concern, as development prevents landward migration.

### Stressor: Coastal Development

**Metric:** Area of salt marsh converted to development (ha/year); length of hardened shoreline.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote sensing.
    *   Land-use planning records.

**Impact on Area:** Direct loss of habitat; fragmentation; prevents landward migration.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of habitat.
    *   Reduced nursery grounds for fish.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Urbanization.
    *   Infrastructure Development.
    *   "Coastal Squeeze."

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Coastal Erosion.
    *   Habitat Loss.

**Logic Description:** Development directly removes marsh habitat and *prevents landward migration* in response to sea level rise, exacerbating the impacts of sea level rise.

### Stressor: Altered Hydrology

**Metric:** Changes in freshwater inflow; presence of ditches and drainage structures.

**Data Sources:**
    *   River gauge data.
    *   Water management records.

**Impact on Area:**
    *   Changes in salinity.
    *   Altered sedimentation.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Shifts in plant communities.
    *   Impacts on invertebrates and fish.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Ditching and Drainage (historical and ongoing).
    *   Roads and Dikes.
    *   Upstream Dams and Diversions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Salinity.
    *   Sedimentation.

**Logic Description:**  Altered hydrology impacts salinity, sedimentation, and habitat.

### Stressor: Pollution (Nutrient Enrichment)

**Metric:** Concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in water and sediments.

**Data Sources:**
    *   EPA data.
    *   State environmental agencies.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Eutrophication.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Changes in plant communities (can favor invasive *Phragmites*).
    *   Reduced oxygen levels in the water.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Agricultural Runoff.
    *   Urban Runoff.
    *   Wastewater Treatment Plants.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Water Quality.
    *   Plant Communities.

**Logic Description:** Nutrient pollution (primarily nitrogen) from agriculture and urban areas is a widespread problem, leading to eutrophication and changes in marsh vegetation.

### Stressor: Invasive Species (*Phragmites australis*)

**Metric:** Extent and density of *Phragmites* stands.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote sensing.
    *   Field surveys.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:**  *Phragmites* can outcompete native marsh vegetation, forming dense monocultures.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Reduced plant diversity.
    *   Loss of habitat for some native marsh animals.
    *   Altered ecosystem processes.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Disturbance:  Roads, ditches, development, nutrient enrichment often create conditions favorable for *Phragmites*.
    *   Altered Hydrology.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Native Plant Communities.
    *   Habitat Structure.

**Logic Description:** The invasive common reed, *Phragmites australis*, is a widespread problem in North American Atlantic Coast salt marshes, outcompeting native plants and altering habitat structure.
