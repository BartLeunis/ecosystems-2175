## Alps Montane

### Stressor: Tourism (Alps)

**Metric:** Number of tourists (winter and summer); area of ski resorts and other tourism infrastructure.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Tourism statistics (various Alpine countries).
    *   Remote sensing data.

**Impact on Area:** Habitat loss and fragmentation; disturbance to wildlife; pollution; pressure on water resources.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Impacts on sensitive alpine ecosystems.
    *   Disturbance to wildlife.
    *   Loss of habitat.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   High Demand for Skiing and Other Mountain Recreation.
    *   Economic Importance of Tourism.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Habitat Fragmentation.
    *   Water Resources.
    * Pollution

**Logic Description:** Tourism, particularly skiing, is a *major* economic activity in the Alps but also a *significant* environmental stressor, impacting habitat, water resources, and wildlife.

### Stressor: Changes in Snowpack (Alps)

**Metric:** Snow depth; snow duration; timing of snowmelt.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Snow monitoring stations.
    *   Remote sensing data.
    *   Climate models.

**Impact on Area:** Impacts on winter tourism; changes in water availability.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Changes in vegetation distribution.
    *   Impacts on species that depend on snow cover.
    *   Altered streamflow regimes.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Temperature Increase.
    *   Changes in Precipitation.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Winter Tourism (skiing).
    *   Water Resources.
    *   Ecosystem Functioning

**Logic Description:** Changes in snowpack, driven by climate change, are impacting winter tourism, water resources, and alpine ecosystems.

### Stressor: Air Pollution (Alps)

**Metric:** Concentrations of pollutants (ozone, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Air quality monitoring networks.
    *   Research studies.

**Impact on Area:** Impacts on forest health; acidification of soils and water.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Damage to vegetation.
    *   Impacts on sensitive species.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Proximity to Industrial Areas: (in Europe).
    *   Traffic Emissions: (in valleys).
    *   Long-Range Transport of Pollutants.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Forest Health.
    *   Water Quality.

**Logic Description:** Air pollution, from both local and distant sources, is a concern in the Alps, impacting forests and water quality.

### Stressor: Land Abandonment

**Metric:** Area of abandoned agricultural land.

**Data Sources:**
        * Agricultural statistics.
        * Remote sensing.

**Impact on Area:** Forest encroachment on alpine meadows.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of open habitat.
   * Changes in species composition.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
         * Socioeconomic changes (rural depopulation).

**Influences (Stressors):**
     * Habitat structure

**Logic Description:** Abandonment of traditional agricultural practices can lead to changes in vegetation.
---
### Stressor: Climate Change
**Metric:** Changes in temperature, precipitation

**Data Sources:**
   * Models, records

**Impact on Area:** Changes to ecosystems

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
 * Shifts in species

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
        * Global GHG

**Influences (Stressors):**
         * Many factors

**Logic Description:** Climate change.
