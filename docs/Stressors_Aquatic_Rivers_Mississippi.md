## Mississippi River

### Stressor: Agricultural Runoff (Nutrient Pollution)

**Metric:** Concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in the Mississippi River and its tributaries; size and severity of the hypoxic zone (dead zone) in the Gulf of Mexico.

**Data Sources:**
    *   US Geological Survey (USGS) National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) program.
    *   NOAA National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS).
    *   State environmental agencies.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** *Major* impact on water quality in the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Hypoxia (oxygen depletion) in the Gulf of Mexico, creating a "dead zone" where marine life cannot survive.
    *   Impacts on fisheries in the Gulf.
    *   Altered food webs.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Agricultural Practices: Use of fertilizers in the vast Mississippi River basin.
    *   Animal Agriculture: Waste from livestock operations.
    *   Lack of Effective Nutrient Management Practices.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Gulf of Mexico Hypoxia (the dominant impact).
    *   Water Quality.

**Logic Description:** Agricultural runoff, carrying excess nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) from fertilizers and animal waste, is the *primary* driver of the large hypoxic zone (dead zone) in the Gulf of Mexico, with significant impacts on marine ecosystems and fisheries. This is one of the most well-known and well-studied environmental problems in the United States.

### Stressor: Dams and Levees (Mississippi River)

**Metric:** Number of dams and levees; changes in river flow and sediment transport; loss of floodplain connectivity.

**Data Sources:**
    *   US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).
    *   USGS.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Altered hydrology; reduced sediment delivery to coastal wetlands; loss of floodplain habitats.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Impacts on fish migration.
    *   Loss of wetlands and floodplain habitats.
    *   Changes in riverine ecosystems.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Flood Control: Levees were built to protect communities and agriculture from flooding.
    *   Navigation: Dams and locks were built to facilitate barge traffic.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Sediment Transport.
    *   Habitat Connectivity.
    *   Coastal Wetland Loss (in Louisiana).

**Logic Description:**  Dams and levees along the Mississippi River, constructed for flood control and navigation, have significantly altered the river's hydrology, reduced sediment delivery to coastal wetlands, and fragmented habitats.

### Stressor: Climate Change (Mississippi River)

**Metric:**  Changes in precipitation; changes in flow; increased frequency of floods and droughts.

**Data Sources:**
    * Climate Models
     * Hydrological Data

**Impact on Area**: Altered flow regimes

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
 * Impacts to fish and wildlife

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
  * Global emissions

**Influences (Stressors):**
   * Floods and droughts.
    * Water quality

**Logic Description:** Climate change may alter precipitation.
