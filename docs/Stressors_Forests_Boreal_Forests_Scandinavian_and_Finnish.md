## Scandinavian and Finnish Boreal Forest

### Stressor: Infrastructure Development (Scandinavian and Finnish Boreal Forest)

**Metric:** Road density (km/km²); area affected by forestry operations (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   National government statistics (Finland, Sweden, Norway).
    *   Remote sensing.

**Impact on Area:** Habitat fragmentation.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss and fragmentation.
    *   Disruption of corridors.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Economic Growth: Demand for timber.
    *   Government Policies: Forestry regulations.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Deforestation (localized).

**Logic Description:** Forestry is a major industry, and related infrastructure (roads) contributes to fragmentation.

### Stressor: Deforestation (Scandinavian and Finnish Boreal Forest)

**Metric:** Area of forest cleared per year (ha/year) (often related to forestry).

**Data Sources:**
    *   National forest inventories.
    *   Remote sensing.

**Impact on Area:** Changes in forest age structure; localized forest loss.
**Impact on Biodiversity:** Impacts are generally less severe than in Canada or Russia due to more intensive forest management, but loss of old-growth patches is still a concern.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
     * Infrastructure
      * Economic Growth
    *   Government Policies: Forestry regulations.

**Influences (Stressors):**
     * Carbon Cycle

**Logic Description:** Intensive forestry practices, while often including reforestation, can still impact biodiversity through changes in forest age structure and loss of old-growth characteristics.

### Stressor: Temperature Increase (Scandinavian and Finnish Boreal Forest)

**Metric:** Average annual temperature increase (°C).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Climate models.
    *   Historical records.

**Impact on Area:** Indirect.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Species shifts (northward).
    *   Increased stress on boreal species.
    *   Changes in phenology.
    *   Increased pest/disease outbreaks.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Wildfires.
    *   Changes in Precipitation.
    * Pest outbreaks

**Logic Description:** Similar to other boreal regions, with rapid warming.

### Stressor: Changes in Precipitation (Scandinavian and Finnish Boreal Forest)

**Metric:** Change in annual precipitation (mm/year); changes in snowpack; seasonality.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Climate models.
    *   Historical records.

**Impact on Area:** Indirect; changes in water availability.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Changes in species composition.
    *   Altered streamflow.
    * Increased risk of drought

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Wildfires (though less of a threat than in drier boreal regions).
      * Water Resources

**Logic Description:** Changes in precipitation patterns impact water availability and ecosystem function.

---

### Stressor: Wildfires (Scandinavian and Finnish Boreal Forest)

**Metric:** Number of fires; area burned (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   National fire statistics.
    *   Remote sensing.

**Impact on Area:** Direct loss of forest area; changes in structure.

**Impact on Biodiversity:** Generally less severe than in Canada or Russia due to more intensive fire management and wetter conditions, but still a concern.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Temperature Increase.
    *   Changes in Precipitation (drought).
    *   Human Activities.

**Influences (Stressors):**
     * Air Quality
     * Future Risk
    * Carbon Cycle

**Logic Description:** Wildfires are a concern, and their risk may increase with climate change, but they are generally less frequent and extensive than in other boreal regions.
---
### Stressor: Invasive Species (Scandinavian and Finnish Boreal Forest)
**Metric:** Distribution and abundance of key invasive species.

**Data Sources:**
        * Forest Health Monitoring.
         * Research.

**Impact on Area:** Changes in forest structure.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
 * Competition.
 * Altered processes.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
 * Disturbance.
  * Climate change.

**Influences (Stressors):**
   * Forest composition

**Logic Description:** Invasive species impact.
