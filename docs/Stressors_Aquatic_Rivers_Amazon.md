## Amazon River

### Stressor: Deforestation (Amazon Basin)

**Metric:** Rate of deforestation (kmÂ²/year); area of forest converted to agriculture and pasture; forest fragmentation.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE) - PRODES, DETER.
    *   Global Forest Watch.
    *   Remote sensing data (Landsat, Sentinel).
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Increased sediment load in the Amazon River and its tributaries; altered hydrological cycle.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of habitat for aquatic and riparian species.
    *   Increased water temperatures in streams due to loss of shade.
    *   Changes in fish communities.
    *   Impacts on migratory fish species.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Agricultural Expansion: (cattle ranching, soybean farming).
    *   Illegal Logging.
    *   Road Construction.
    *   Mining.
    *   Weak Environmental Governance.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Sedimentation (major impact).
    *   Hydrology.
    *   Water Quality.

**Logic Description:** Deforestation in the Amazon basin is the *primary* driver of environmental change in the Amazon River system. It leads to increased soil erosion, resulting in higher sediment loads in rivers, altered flow patterns, and impacts on aquatic life.

### Stressor: Hydropower Dams (Amazon River)

**Metric:** Number of dams constructed and planned; changes in river flow; area of land flooded by reservoirs.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Brazilian National Electric Energy Agency (ANEEL).
    *   Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) for dam projects.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Altered flow regimes; fragmentation of river habitats; blockage of fish migration routes; changes in sediment transport; greenhouse gas emissions from reservoirs (methane).

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Impacts on fish populations (particularly migratory species).
    *   Loss of riverine and floodplain habitats.
    *   Changes in aquatic food webs.
    *   Impacts on indigenous communities.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Demand for Electricity: In Brazil and neighboring countries.
    *   Government Energy Policies.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Fish Migration.
    *   Sediment Transport.
    *   Habitat Connectivity.
    *   Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Logic Description:**  Hydropower dam construction is a rapidly growing threat to the Amazon River system, altering flow patterns, blocking fish migration, fragmenting habitats, and releasing greenhouse gases.

### Stressor: Climate Change (Amazon River)

**Metric:** Changes in precipitation patterns; changes in river discharge; increased frequency and severity of droughts and floods; water temperature.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Climate models.
    *   Hydrological data (river gauge measurements).
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Altered hydrological cycle; increased risk of extreme events.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Impacts on fish and other aquatic organisms.
    *   Changes in floodplain inundation patterns, affecting plant and animal communities.
    *   Increased stress on ecosystems already impacted by deforestation and dams.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.
    *   Deforestation (can exacerbate local climate change impacts).

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Hydrology.
    *   Extreme Events (Floods and Droughts).
    *   Water Temperature.

**Logic Description:** Climate change is impacting the Amazon River through changes in precipitation, increased frequency of extreme events, and interactions with other stressors like deforestation.

### Stressor: Pollution (Amazon River)

**Metric:** Concentrations of pollutants (mercury from gold mining, pesticides, sewage).

**Data Sources:**
        * Research studies
         * Government monitoring

**Impact on Area:** Localized and regional water quality issues.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
* Toxic effects on fish and other organisms.
        * Bioaccumulation of mercury in the food chain.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
  * Gold mining (mercury).
 * Agriculture (pesticides).
  * Urban areas (sewage).

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Water Quality.
  * Wildlife and human health.

**Logic Description:**  Mining, agriculture, and urban areas contribute to pollution.
