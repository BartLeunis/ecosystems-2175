## Southeast Asian Mangroves

### Stressor: Aquaculture Expansion

**Metric:** Area of mangroves converted to aquaculture ponds (primarily shrimp farms) (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote sensing data.
    *   Government statistics (Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, etc.).
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** *Massive* loss of mangrove habitat. This is the *dominant* driver of mangrove loss in Southeast Asia.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of habitat for a wide range of species.
    *   Reduced nursery grounds for fish and shellfish.
    *   Loss of coastal protection.
    *   Water pollution from aquaculture effluent.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Demand for Shrimp: A major economic driver.
    *   Government Policies: Promotion of aquaculture development (in some cases).
    *   Lack of Enforcement of Environmental Regulations.
    *   Poverty and Lack of Alternative Livelihoods.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Coastal Erosion.
    *   Water Quality (pollution from ponds).
    *   Habitat Loss (the primary impact).

**Logic Description:** The conversion of mangroves to aquaculture ponds, primarily for shrimp farming, is the *single largest cause* of mangrove loss in Southeast Asia. This has devastating impacts on biodiversity, coastal protection, and water quality.

### Stressor: Deforestation (for other reasons)

**Metric:** Area of mangroves cleared per year (ha/year) (for timber, charcoal, etc.).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote sensing data.
    *   Government statistics.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Loss of mangrove habitat.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss.
    *   Reduced carbon sequestration.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Demand for Timber and Fuelwood: Local use and export.
    *   Poverty and Lack of Alternative Livelihoods.
    *   Coastal Development

**Influences (Stressors):**
     * Coastal erosion

**Logic Description:** Deforestation for timber, fuelwood, and charcoal production also contributes to mangrove loss.

### Stressor: Pollution

**Metric:** Concentrations of pollutants (nutrients, heavy metals, plastics) in water and sediment.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Water quality monitoring data (often limited).
    *   Research studies.

**Impact on Area:** Water quality degradation.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Toxic effects on mangroves and associated fauna.
    *   Eutrophication.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Industrial Discharge.
    *   Urban Runoff.
    *   Agricultural Runoff.
    *   Aquaculture Effluent.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Mangrove Health.
    *   Water Quality.

**Logic Description:** Pollution from various sources degrades water quality and impacts mangrove ecosystems.

### Stressor: Climate Change (Southeast Asian Mangroves)
**Metric:** Sea Level Rise, Temperature, Storms

**Data Sources:**
    * Climate Models
   * Tide Gauges
    * Weather records

**Impact on Area:** Innundation, Erosion, Storm Damage.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
  * Species Shifts
  * Increased Stress

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    * Global GHG

**Influences (Stressors):**
     * Sea level
      * Storm surge

**Logic Description:**  Climate change impacts.
