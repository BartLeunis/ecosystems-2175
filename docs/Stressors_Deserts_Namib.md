## Namib Desert

### Stressor: Climate Change (Namib Desert)

**Metric:** Temperature increase (Â°C); changes in fog frequency and intensity; changes in precipitation (mm/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Climate models.
    *   Historical weather records (limited).
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Increased aridity; potential shifts in fog patterns.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   The Namib Desert is highly adapted to fog, and changes in fog patterns could have *significant* impacts on species that depend on it.
    *   Increased stress on desert species due to higher temperatures.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Fog Patterns: A *critical* factor for the Namib.

**Logic Description:** Climate change impacts on temperature and, *crucially*, fog patterns, threaten the unique adaptations of Namib Desert species.

### Stressor: Mining (Namib Desert)

**Metric:** Area affected by mining operations (ha); water use by mining; pollution levels.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Government mining records (Namibia).
    *   Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs).
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Habitat loss and degradation; water depletion; pollution.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Direct habitat destruction.
    *   Impacts on water resources.
    *   Potential for toxic effects from pollutants.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Demand for Minerals: (e.g., uranium, diamonds).
    *   Government Policies.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Water Resources.
    *   Pollution.

**Logic Description:** Mining activities, particularly for uranium and diamonds, can impact fragile desert habitats and water resources.

### Stressor: Off-Road Driving
**Metric:** Area impacted

**Data Sources:**
        * Remote sensing
        * Research

**Impact on Area:**
         * Disturbance to soil crusts

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
        *   Impacts on slow-growing lichens and other desert organisms.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
 * Tourism

**Influences (Stressors):**
        * Soil and vegetation

**Logic Description:** Off-road driving can damage sensitive desert ecosystems.
