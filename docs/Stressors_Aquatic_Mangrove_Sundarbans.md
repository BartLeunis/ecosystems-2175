## Sundarbans (India and Bangladesh)

### Stressor: Coastal Development (Sundarbans)

**Metric:** Area of mangroves converted to other land uses (ha/year); population density in coastal areas.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote sensing data.
    *   Government statistics (India and Bangladesh).
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Direct loss of mangrove habitat; fragmentation.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of habitat for a wide range of species, including the Bengal tiger.
    *   Reduced nursery grounds for fish and shellfish.
    *   Loss of coastal protection.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Population Growth: High population density in the region.
    *   Poverty and Lack of Alternative Livelihoods.
    *   Shrimp Farming: Expansion of shrimp farms.
    *   Infrastructure Development (ports, roads).

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Coastal Erosion.
    *   Water Quality.

**Logic Description:** Coastal development, driven by population growth, poverty, and economic activities like shrimp farming, is a significant threat to the Sundarbans, leading to habitat loss and fragmentation.

### Stressor: Deforestation (Sundarbans)

**Metric:** Area of mangroves cleared per year (ha/year) (often illegal logging).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote sensing data.
    *   Forest department data (often incomplete).
    *   Reports from environmental organizations.

**Impact on Area:** Direct loss of mangrove habitat.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss.
    *   Reduced carbon sequestration.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Poverty and Lack of Alternative Livelihoods: Fuelwood collection, timber harvesting.
    *   Weak Law Enforcement.
    *   Corruption.

**Influences (Stressors):**
        * Coastal erosion

**Logic Description:** Deforestation, often illegal, for fuelwood, timber, and land clearing, reduces mangrove area.

### Stressor: Pollution (Sundarbans)

**Metric:** Concentrations of pollutants (e.g., heavy metals, pesticides, plastics) in water, sediment, and mangrove tissues.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Water quality monitoring data (limited).
    *   Research studies.

**Impact on Area:** Degradation of water quality; contamination of sediments.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Toxic effects on mangroves and associated fauna.
    *   Impacts on fish populations.
    *   Potential for bioaccumulation in the food chain.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Industrial Discharge: From industries located upstream.
    *   Agricultural Runoff: Pesticides and fertilizers.
    *   Urban Runoff: Sewage and industrial effluent.
    *   Shipping Activities: Oil spills and discharge of waste.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Mangrove Health.
    *   Water Quality.
    * Wildlife populations.

**Logic Description:** Pollution from upstream industrial sources, agriculture, and shipping activities degrades water quality and impacts the Sundarbans ecosystem.

### Stressor: Climate Change (Sundarbans)

**Metric:** Sea level rise (mm/year); sea surface temperature (Â°C); changes in precipitation patterns; increased storm intensity and frequency; cyclone frequency.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Climate models.
    *   Tide gauge records.
    *   Remote sensing data.
    *   Historical weather records.

**Impact on Area:**
    *   Coastal inundation and erosion: The Sundarbans is *extremely* vulnerable to sea level rise.
    *   Increased salinity in estuaries and waterways.
    *   Increased damage from storm surges.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of mangrove habitat due to sea level rise.
    *   Shifts in species distributions.
    *   Increased stress on mangroves and associated fauna.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Sea Level Rise (the dominant impact).
    *   Coastal Erosion.
    *   Salinity Intrusion.
    *   Storm Surge.

**Logic Description:** Climate change, particularly sea level rise, poses an *existential* threat to the Sundarbans. Increased storm intensity and changes in freshwater input also have significant impacts.

### Stressor: Upstream Water Diversions
**Metric:** River flow rates into the Sundarbans.

**Data Sources:**
 * Government data
 * Research.

**Impact on Area:** Altered salinity and sediment delivery.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
        * Impacts on mangrove and aquatic species.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    * Water management in India and Bangladesh (e.g., Farakka Barrage).

**Influences (Stressors):**
* Salinity.
* Sedimentation.

**Logic Description:** Upstream water diversions reduce freshwater flow, increasing salinity and affecting sediment delivery.
