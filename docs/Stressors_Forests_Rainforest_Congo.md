## Congo Rainforest

### Stressor: Infrastructure Development (Congo Rainforest)

**Metric:** Length of new roads constructed per year (km/year), and/or area directly affected by other infrastructure projects (dams, pipelines, mining operations) (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Governmental and industry reports on infrastructure projects.
    *   Remote sensing data (satellite imagery).
    *   Reports from environmental organizations and research institutions (e.g., World Resources Institute, Rainforest Foundation).

**Impact on Area:** Direct loss of rainforest area; increased fragmentation.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss and fragmentation.
    *   Disruption of ecological corridors.
    *   Increased access for hunting and poaching.
    *   Impacts on aquatic ecosystems from dams.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Economic Growth: Demand for resources (timber, minerals).
    *   Population Growth: Increased demand for land and resources.
    *   Government Policies: Infrastructure development plans and regulations.
    *   Global Commodity Prices: Prices for timber, minerals, and other resources.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Deforestation: Roads facilitate logging and agricultural expansion.
    *   Wildfires: Increased risk due to human activity.
    *   Pollution: Mining and other industrial activities.

**Logic Description:** Similar to the Amazon, infrastructure development (roads, dams, mines) directly reduces rainforest area and fragments habitat. This leads to biodiversity loss through habitat loss, disruption of ecological processes, and increased human access for hunting and poaching.

### Stressor: Deforestation (Congo Rainforest)

**Metric:** Area of forest cleared per year (hectares/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote sensing data (satellite imagery).
    *   Reports from environmental organizations and research institutions.
    *   Governmental data (where available and reliable).

**Impact on Area:** Direct reduction of rainforest area.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss and fragmentation.
    *   Loss of carbon storage.
    *   Disruption of ecological processes.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Infrastructure Development: Access for logging and agriculture.
    *   Economic Growth: Demand for timber and agricultural land.
    *   Global Commodity Prices: Prices for timber, palm oil, and other commodities.
    *   Population Growth: Subsistence agriculture and fuelwood collection.
    *   Government Policies: Weak enforcement of environmental regulations.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Wildfires: Increased susceptibility to fire.
    *   Changes in Precipitation (potentially).

**Logic Description:** Deforestation, driven by logging (both legal and illegal), agricultural expansion (including small-scale subsistence farming), and fuelwood collection, directly reduces forest area and biodiversity.

### Stressor: Temperature Increase (Congo Rainforest)

**Metric:** Average annual temperature increase (Â°C) above a pre-industrial baseline.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Global climate models (GCMs) projections.
    *   Regional climate models.
    *   Historical temperature records (limited availability in some areas).

**Impact on Area:** Indirect; exacerbates other stressors.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Shifts in species distributions.
    *   Increased physiological stress.
    *   Increased risk of exceeding thermal limits.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.
    *   Deforestation: Reduced carbon sequestration.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Wildfires: Increased fire risk.
    *   Changes in Precipitation.

**Logic Description:**  Global warming, exacerbated locally by deforestation, increases temperatures, stressing species and increasing the risk of other stressors like wildfires.

### Stressor: Changes in Precipitation (Congo Rainforest)

**Metric:** Change in annual precipitation (mm/year); changes in dry season length and severity.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Global and regional climate models.
    *   Historical rainfall records (limited availability).

**Impact on Area:** Indirect; potential vegetation shifts.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Changes in species distributions.
    *   Increased drought stress.
    *   Altered river flow regimes.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.
    *   Deforestation (potentially).

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Wildfires: Increased fire risk with longer dry seasons.

**Logic Description:** Climate change and potentially deforestation alter rainfall patterns, increasing drought stress and affecting aquatic ecosystems.

### Stressor: Wildfires (Congo Rainforest)

**Metric:** Number of wildfires per year; total area burned (hectares/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *    Remote sensing data (satellite imagery).
    *    Reports from local communities and environmental organizations.

**Impact on Area:** Direct loss of forest area.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *    Direct mortality of plants and animals.
    *   Habitat loss.
    *    Air pollution.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Deforestation: Creates drier, more flammable conditions.
    *   Temperature Increase: Increased fire risk.
    *    Changes in Precipitation: Longer dry seasons increase risk.
    *   Human Activities: Agricultural burning, accidental fires.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Deforestation.

**Logic Description:** Wildfires, often linked to deforestation and agricultural practices, are exacerbated by climate change, leading to direct forest loss and biodiversity impacts.
