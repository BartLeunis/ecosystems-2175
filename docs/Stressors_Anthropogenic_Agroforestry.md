## Agroforestry

### Stressor: Land Use Change (Agroforestry)

**Metric:** Conversion of natural forest or other land cover types to agroforestry systems; conversion of agroforestry to other land uses (e.g., monoculture agriculture, urban development).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote sensing data (satellite imagery, aerial photography).
    *   Land use/land cover maps.
    *   Agricultural statistics.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Changes in land cover and landscape structure.  Can be *positive* (e.g., converting degraded land to agroforestry) or *negative* (e.g., converting forest to a simplified agroforestry system).

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Depends on the type of agroforestry system and the previous land use. Agroforestry can *increase* biodiversity compared to monoculture agriculture, but may *decrease* it compared to natural forest.
    *   Can provide habitat for some species, but may not support specialized forest species.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Agroforestry - Economic Incentives: Market demand for agroforestry products (e.g., timber, fruits, nuts, coffee, cocoa).
    *   Agroforestry - Government Policies: Subsidies, regulations, land tenure.
    *   Agroforestry - Population Pressure: Demand for land and resources.
    *   Agroforestry - Climate Change: May influence the suitability of certain agroforestry systems.
