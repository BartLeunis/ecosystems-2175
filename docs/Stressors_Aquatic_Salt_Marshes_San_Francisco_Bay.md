## San Francisco Bay Salt Marshes

### Stressor: Historical Habitat Loss

**Metric:** Area of salt marsh lost since pre-development times (a *very* large percentage).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Historical maps and records.
    *   Research publications.
    *   San Francisco Estuary Institute (SFEI) data.

**Impact on Area:** *Massive* reduction in salt marsh area (over 90% in many parts of the Bay).

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of habitat for endangered species (e.g., salt marsh harvest mouse, Ridgway's rail).
    *   Reduced nursery grounds for fish and shellfish.
    *   Loss of coastal protection.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Historical Diking and Filling: For agriculture, salt production, and urban development.  This is the *overwhelming* historical driver.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Current Habitat Availability (the primary legacy).

**Logic Description:** The San Francisco Bay has lost a *vast* majority of its historical salt marshes due to diking and filling for agriculture, salt ponds, and urban development. This historical loss is the *defining* characteristic of the ecosystem's current state and its vulnerability.

### Stressor: Sea Level Rise

**Metric:** Rate of sea level rise (mm/year); marsh elevation; accretion rates.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Tide gauge records (NOAA).
    *   Satellite altimetry.
    *   Sediment core analysis.
    *   SFEI data.

**Impact on Area:** Inundation and erosion of remaining marshes; "coastal squeeze."

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Further habitat loss.
    *   Shifts in species composition.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.
    *   Local Subsidence (in some areas).

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Coastal Erosion.
    *   Habitat Loss.

**Logic Description:** Sea level rise is a growing threat, exacerbating the impacts of historical habitat loss and making restoration efforts more challenging.  Many remaining marshes are "squeezed" between rising seas and development.

### Stressor: Invasive Species (*Spartina alterniflora* and hybrids)

**Metric:** Extent and density of invasive *Spartina* (cordgrass) stands.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote sensing data (hyperspectral imagery).
    *   Field surveys.
    *   San Francisco Estuary Invasive Spartina Project data.

**Impact on Area:**  *Spartina alterniflora* and its hybrids can outcompete native marsh vegetation and alter sediment dynamics.  It can *increase* overall vegetated area in some cases, but in a way that is detrimental to the native ecosystem.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of native plant diversity (especially *Spartina foliosa*, the native Pacific cordgrass).
    *   Changes in habitat structure.
    *   Impacts on invertebrate and bird communities (both positive and negative, depending on the species and the specific context).
    * Can increase sedimentation and elevation, but in ways that are not always beneficial.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Intentional Introduction:  *Spartina alterniflora* was intentionally introduced for erosion control.
    *   Hybridization: Hybridization with native *Spartina foliosa* has created more aggressive forms.
    *   Disturbance: Altered hydrology and disturbed areas can favor *Spartina* invasion.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Native Plant Communities.
    *   Sediment Dynamics.
    *   Habitat Structure.

**Logic Description:** Invasive *Spartina* species, particularly hybrids between the introduced *Spartina alterniflora* and the native *Spartina foliosa*, are a major problem in San Francisco Bay, outcompeting native plants, altering mudflat and marsh habitats, and impacting wildlife.

### Stressor: Pollution

**Metric:** Concentrations of pollutants (nutrients, heavy metals, legacy contaminants) in water and sediment.

**Data Sources:**
 * Water quality monitoring programs (San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board).
   * Research Studies

**Impact on Area:** Degraded water and sediment quality.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
 * Impacts on marsh plants and animals; bioaccumulation of toxins.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
 * Urban Runoff.
    * Industrial Discharge (historical and ongoing).
    * Legacy Pollutants: Contaminants from past industrial activities are still present in sediments.
   * Agricultural Runoff.

**Influences (Stressors):**
  * Water and sediment quality.
  * Marsh health.

**Logic Description:** The San Francisco Bay is surrounded by a large urban and industrial area, and pollution from runoff, industrial discharge, and legacy contaminants is a concern.

### Stressor: Altered Hydrology

**Metric:** Changes to tidal and freshwater flows

**Data Sources:**
    * Water management records.
 * Research

**Impact on Area:** Changes in salinity and sedimentation

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
 * Species shifts

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
* Water diversions
 * Levees

**Influences (Stressors):**
* Salinity and Sedimentation

**Logic Description:** Alterations to water flow impacts the system.
