## South American Kelp Forests (Chile, Argentina)

### Stressor: Overfishing (of urchin predators)

**Metric:** Abundance of key urchin predators (e.g., certain fish species, sea stars); sea urchin density; kelp cover.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Fisheries data (often limited).
    *   Underwater surveys.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Potential for urchin barren formation.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of kelp forest habitat.
    *   Reduced biodiversity.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Overfishing of Urchin Predators.
    *   Demand for Seafood.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Kelp Forest Cover.

**Logic Description:** Overfishing of predators can lead to increased urchin grazing and kelp forest loss.  This is a *potential* threat, and the specific predators and dynamics may differ from the Northern Hemisphere.

### Stressor: Sea Urchin Harvesting

**Metric**: Urchin catch data

**Data Sources:**
    * Fisheries data

**Impact on Area:** Potential for kelp forest expansion (if urchins are heavily harvested).

**Impact on Biodiversity**:
  * Can be positive or negative.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
 * Demand for urchin roe (uni).

**Influences (Stressors):**
 * Urchin populations
  * Kelp cover.

**Logic Description**: In some areas, sea urchins are harvested for their roe (uni). This can have *complex* effects on kelp forests. It *could* reduce grazing pressure, but it also removes a component of the ecosystem.

### Stressor: Climate Change (South American Kelp Forests)

**Metric:** Sea surface temperature (SST) (Â°C); ocean acidification (pH).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Climate models.
    *   Oceanographic data.

**Impact on Area:**  Potential changes in kelp distribution and growth.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
        * Impacts to be determined

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**

**Logic Description:**  The impacts of climate change on South American kelp forests are still being researched, but warming waters and acidification are potential threats.
