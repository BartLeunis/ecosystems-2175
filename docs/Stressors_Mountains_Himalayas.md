## Himalayas Montane

### Stressor: Glacier Retreat (Himalayas)

**Metric:** Change in glacier area and volume; glacier mass balance; changes in meltwater runoff.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote sensing data.
    *   Field measurements (limited, but increasing).
    *   Research publications (e.g., from ICIMOD - International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development).

**Impact on Area:** *Rapid* glacier loss; changes in river flow.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Changes in downstream water availability, impacting aquatic ecosystems *and a vast human population*.
    *   Loss of habitat for glacier-dependent species.
    *   Increased risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs).

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Temperature Increase.
    *   Black Carbon Deposition: *Significant* in the Himalayas, accelerating melting.
    *   Changes in Precipitation (in some areas).

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Water Resources: *Critically* important for downstream populations.
    *   Hazard Risks (GLOFs): A *major* concern.

**Logic Description:** Glacier retreat in the Himalayas is a *major* issue, driven by climate change and black carbon deposition.  This impacts water resources for a *huge* downstream population and increases the risk of glacial lake outburst floods.

### Stressor: Black Carbon Deposition (Himalayas)

**Metric:** Concentration of black carbon in snow and ice; changes in albedo (reflectivity) of snow and ice.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Field measurements (on glaciers).
    *   Atmospheric monitoring.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Accelerates glacier melting.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Indirect, through impacts on glacier retreat and water resources.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Burning of Fossil Fuels: In South Asia and other regions.
    *   Biomass Burning: (e.g., cooking fires, agricultural burning).

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Glacier Retreat: A *major* contributing factor.

**Logic Description:** Black carbon (soot) deposition on Himalayan glaciers darkens the surface, reducing its reflectivity and accelerating melting.  This is a significant contributor to glacier retreat.

### Stressor: Overgrazing and Collection of Medicinal Plants (Himalayas)
**Metric:** Livestock density; abundance of key medicinal plant species.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Agricultural statistics.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Degradation of alpine meadows; decline of medicinal plant populations.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
      * Loss of plant diversity.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
     * Population growth
     * Economic pressures

**Influences (Stressors):**
     * Plant communities

**Logic Description:** Overgrazing and collection pressures on plant resources.

### Stressor: Tourism (Himalayas)

**Metric:** Number of tourists; development of tourism infrastructure.

**Data Sources:**
         * Tourism statistics.

**Impact on Area:** Localized impacts on vegetation and waste management.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
       * Disturbance to wildlife.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
         * Increasing popularity of trekking and mountaineering.

**Influences (Stressors):**
         * Local environments.

**Logic Description:** Tourism can have localized negative impacts.

---
### Stressor: Climate Change

**Metric:** Changes in temp, precip, and extreme weather

**Data Sources:**
         * Climate models, historical records

**Impact on Area:** Impacts on fragile ecosystems

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    * Shifts and stress

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
        * Global GHG

**Influences (Stressors):**
    * Water resources.

**Logic Description:** Climate change.
