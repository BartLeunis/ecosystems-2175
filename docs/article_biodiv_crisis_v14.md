# Ecosystem Loss Simulation: A No-Mitigation View of Biodiversity Decline (2025–2175)

## Introduction
The accelerating impacts of climate change pose a severe threat to global ecosystems and biodiversity. This simulation models the potential loss of ecosystem function across 13 key ecosystems from 2025 to 2175 under a "no mitigation" scenario, where no significant policy interventions or adaptive measures are implemented to curb climate change or biodiversity loss. By assuming unmitigated emissions and environmental degradation, this model establishes a worst-case baseline to highlight the urgency of action and inform future mitigation strategies. The ecosystems modeled include the Amazon Rainforest, Coral Reefs, Arctic Sea Ice, Boreal Forests, Savanna Grasslands, Wetlands, Oceans, Temperate Forests, Deserts, Tundra, Montane, Freshwater, and Polar.

## Methodology
The simulation integrates several ecological dynamics:
- **Base Loss Rates**: Annual loss rates vary by ecosystem and scenario (Low, Mid, High), drawn from a t-distribution (df=3). For example, the Amazon Rainforest loses 0.005% annually in the High scenario, while Coral Reefs lose 0.025%.
- **Transformation Dynamics**: Ecosystems transform into others upon degradation (e.g., Amazon Rainforest → Savanna Grasslands). Offsets are applied until the source ecosystem reaches its maximum loss (e.g., 95% for Amazon), after which the target ecosystem accumulates its own losses.
- **Cascade Effects**: Interdependencies amplify losses (e.g., Coral Reefs → Oceans: 1.1 multiplier).
- **Stochastic Shocks**: 2% annual probability of shocks (±0.05 magnitude, ±0.15 for Coral Reefs/Arctic Sea Ice), simulating extreme climate events.
- **Total Biodiversity Loss**: Weighted by species diversity (e.g., Amazon Rainforest: 0.25, Coral Reefs: 0.15), with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and risk thresholds (50% for food/health risks, 70% for survival threats).

The model runs 10,000 iterations over 150 years, with no mitigation measures (e.g., carbon reduction, restoration) to reflect a worst-case scenario. See `methodology.md` for details.

## Results
The simulation reveals severe biodiversity declines under unmitigated climate change:
- **Coral Reefs**: 99% loss by 2050 in High scenarios, driven by high base rates (0.025) and shocks.
- **Amazon Rainforest**: 95% loss by 2100, reflecting deforestation and climate impacts.
- **Savanna Grasslands**: 0% loss until 2100 (offset by Amazon transformation), then 60% by 2175 in High scenarios.
- **Arctic Sea Ice**: 80% loss by 2050, stable thereafter.
- **Oceans**: ~85% loss by 2175, post-Coral transformation.

**Total Biodiversity Loss (2175)**:
- **Low Scenario**: 61.3% (No Shock) to 62.8% (With Shock), exceeding 50% by 2125 (food/health risks).
- **Mid Scenario**: 75.4% to 77.3%, exceeding 70% (survival threat).
- **High Scenario**: 96.4% in both No Shock and With Shock, indicating near-total collapse.

These results underscore the catastrophic impact of unmitigated climate change, with High scenarios approaching extinction-level biodiversity loss by 2175.

## Visualizations

- **Ecosystem Breakdown**: Bar chart (`ecosystem_breakdown_2175_high_shock.png`) for 2175 High With-Shocks, highlighting transformed ecosystems (e.g., Amazon, Coral Reefs).
- **Ecosystem-Specific Trajectories**: 4x4 grid (`ecosystem_specific_loss_trajectories.png`) of loss over time per ecosystem, revealing distinct patterns (e.g., Coral Reefs’ rapid decline, Savanna Grasslands’ delayed rise).

## Discussion
This no-mitigation scenario paints a dire picture: without intervention, biodiversity loss exceeds critical thresholds, threatening food security, health, and human survival. Coral Reefs collapse by 2050, the Amazon Rainforest by 2100, and total loss nears 96.4% in High scenarios—levels incompatible with sustaining current ecosystems and human systems. The model’s assumptions (e.g., linear loss rates, no recovery) amplify this outcome, but the results align with worst-case projections (IPCC AR6, Nobre et al., 2016).

## Next Steps
This simulation serves as a baseline for future work on mitigation strategies. The next phase will explore solutions, including:
- **Policy Interventions**: Modeling carbon reduction, reforestation, and protected areas.
- **Adaptive Measures**: Simulating ecosystem restoration and species adaptation.
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Adding post-shock regrowth probabilities.
- **Refined Parameters**: Adjusting base rates (e.g., Coral Reefs to 0.015) and species weights with empirical data.

By comparing mitigated scenarios to this no-mitigation baseline, we aim to quantify the effectiveness of interventions in preserving biodiversity and averting ecological collapse.

## Conclusion
The no-mitigation view highlights the urgent need for action. With 96.4% biodiversity loss in High scenarios by 2175, the stakes are clear: without mitigation, global ecosystems face near-total collapse. The next phase of this project will focus on solutions to steer us toward a more sustainable future.
