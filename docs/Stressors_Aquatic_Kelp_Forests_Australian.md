## Australian Kelp Forests

### Stressor: Ocean Warming

**Metric:** Sea surface temperature (SST) (Â°C); frequency and severity of marine heatwaves.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) data.
    *   Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS).
    *   Research publications (e.g., from CSIRO, universities).

**Impact on Area:** *Major* kelp forest declines and die-offs, particularly in Western Australia and Tasmania.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of habitat.
    *   Shifts in community structure (towards more warm-tolerant species and *turf algae*).
    *   Range contractions of kelp species.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.
    *   Strengthening of the East Australian Current (EAC): Bringing warmer waters further south.

**Influences (Stressors):**
        * Range shifts

**Logic Description:** Ocean warming, particularly marine heatwaves, has caused *severe* and widespread kelp forest declines in parts of Australia, leading to significant ecosystem shifts. This is a major area of concern and research.

### Stressor: Overgrazing (by sea urchins and other herbivores)

**Metric:** Sea urchin density; abundance of other herbivorous fish; kelp cover.

**Data Sources:**
  * Underwater Surveys
   * Research

**Impact on Area:** Formation of urchin barrens.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of kelp forest habitat.
   * Reduced biodiversity.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Overfishing of Urchin Predators: (e.g., rock lobsters).
   * Ocean Warming

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Kelp Cover.

**Logic Description:** Overgrazing by sea urchins (and in some areas, certain fish species) can lead to the formation of urchin barrens, particularly where predator populations have been reduced.

### Stressor: Invasive Species

**Metric:** Distribution and abundance of invasive species (e.g., *Undaria pinnatifida* - Japanese kelp).

**Data Sources:**
     * Underwater surveys.
     * Research.

**Impact on Area:** Competition with native kelp species.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
 * Can outcompete native kelp and alter habitat structure.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
   * Shipping (ballast water, hull fouling).
  * Aquaculture

**Influences (Stressors):**
        * Native kelp populations

**Logic Description**: Invasive species are a threat.
