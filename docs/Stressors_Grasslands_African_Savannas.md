## African Savannas

### Stressor: Land-Use Change (African Savannas)

**Metric:** Area converted to agriculture, settlements, or other land uses (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote sensing data.
    *   National government statistics.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Loss of savanna habitat; fragmentation.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss and fragmentation.
    *   Disruption of migration routes (for large mammals).
    *   Increased human-wildlife conflict.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    * African Savannas - Agricultural Expansion
    * African Savannas - Population Growth
    * African Savannas - Government Policies

**Influences (Stressors):**
     *  African Savannas - Habitat Fragmentation

**Logic Description:** Conversion of savanna to agriculture and settlements is a major threat, leading to habitat loss, fragmentation, and increased conflict between humans and wildlife.

### Stressor: Habitat Fragmentation (African Savannas)

**Metric:** Patch size distribution; edge density; connectivity indices.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Land cover data (from remote sensing).
    *   GIS analysis.

**Impact on Area:** Remaining savanna exists in increasingly isolated patches.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Reduced gene flow.
    *   Increased edge effects.
    *   Limited dispersal ability.
    *   Increased vulnerability to stochastic events.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *  African Savannas - Land-Use Change

**Influences (Stressors):**
 * Exacerbates other stressor impacts

**Logic Description:** Fragmentation isolates savanna patches, reducing their ecological viability and increasing the vulnerability of wildlife populations.

### Stressor: Climate Change (African Savannas)

**Metric:** Temperature increase (Â°C); changes in precipitation (mm/year, seasonality); increased frequency and severity of drought.

**Data Sources:**
 * Climate models.
 * Historical records

**Impact on Area:** Indirect; changes in growing conditions.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Shifts in species distributions.
    *   Increased stress on savanna species.
    *   Changes in phenology.
    *   Increased fire risk (in some areas).
    *   Changes in water availability.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
   * Global GHG

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *  African Savannas - Fire Regimes
    *  African Savannas - Water Availability

**Logic Description:** Climate change is altering temperature and precipitation patterns, increasing stress on savanna ecosystems and impacting water resources.

### Stressor: Wildfires (African Savannas)

**Metric:** Fire frequency (return interval); area burned (ha/year); fire intensity.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote sensing data (fire detection).
    *   Research studies.
    *   Local community knowledge.

**Impact on Area:** Changes in vegetation structure and composition (can be both beneficial and detrimental, depending on fire regime).

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Many savanna species are adapted to fire, and fire is a natural and important process.
    *   However, changes in fire frequency, intensity, or timing (due to climate change or human activities) can have negative impacts.
    *   Too frequent or intense fires can damage trees and favor grasses.
    *   Too infrequent fires can lead to woody encroachment.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *  African Savannas - Climate Change
    *  African Savannas - Human Activities
    *  African Savannas - Land-Use Change

**Influences (Stressors):**
   *  African Savannas - Vegetation Structure

**Logic Description:** Fire is a natural and important process in savannas, but changes in fire regimes due to climate change and human activities can have significant ecological impacts.

### Stressor: Poaching (African Savannas)

**Metric:** Number of illegally killed animals (for key species, e.g., elephants, rhinos); poaching incidents.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Law enforcement data.
    *   Wildlife monitoring programs.
    *   Reports from conservation organizations.

**Impact on Area:** Indirect (through impacts on wildlife populations).

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Decline of key species (e.g., elephants, rhinos, lions).
    *   Cascading effects on the ecosystem (e.g., loss of keystone herbivores can alter vegetation structure).
    *   Loss of genetic diversity.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    * African Savannas - Demand for Wildlife Products
    * African Savannas - Poverty
    * African Savannas - Weak Governance
    * African Savannas - Organized Crime

**Influences (Stressors):**
     *  African Savannas - Wildlife Populations
     *  African Savannas - Ecosystem Function

**Logic Description:** Poaching, driven by demand for wildlife products and other factors, is a major threat to many savanna species, with cascading effects on the ecosystem.

### Stressor: Overgrazing (African Savannas)

**Metric:** Livestock density; vegetation cover and composition; soil erosion.

**Data Sources:**
   * Agricultural statistics
   * Vegetation surveys.
   * Remote sensing

**Impact on Area:** Changes in vegetation structure; soil degradation.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
     *   Loss of palatable plant species.
    *   Spread of unpalatable or invasive species.
    * Soil compaction and erosion.
    * Competition with wild herbivores.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
 *  African Savannas - Livestock Management
    *   African Savannas - Population Growth: Increased demand for livestock products.

**Influences (Stressors):**
 *  African Savannas - Vegetation Structure

**Logic Description:** Overgrazing by livestock can degrade savanna vegetation, leading to soil erosion and competition with wild herbivores.

        *  African Savannas - Climate Change

**Influences (Stressors):**
      *  African Savannas - Native plant communities

**Logic Description:** Invasive species can outcompete native plants and alter ecosystem processes.
