## California Kelp Forests

### Stressor: Ocean Warming

**Metric:** Sea surface temperature (SST) (°C); frequency and severity of marine heatwaves; Degree Heating Weeks (DHW).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Satellite data (e.g., NOAA Coral Reef Watch, CoastWatch).
    *   In-situ temperature loggers (e.g., from Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute - MBARI).
    *   Climate models.

**Impact on Area:** Reduced kelp growth and survival; kelp forest die-offs during extreme events (e.g., "The Blob" marine heatwave).

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of habitat for many fish, invertebrates, and marine mammals.
    *   Changes in community structure (shift towards more warm-tolerant species, including invasive species).
    *   Increased vulnerability to other stressors.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Primary driver.
    *   El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO): El Niño events can bring warmer waters to the California coast.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Sea Urchin Barrens Formation.
    *   Disease outbreaks

**Logic Description:** Rising ocean temperatures, and *especially* marine heatwaves, are a *major* threat to California kelp forests, causing widespread kelp mortality and ecosystem shifts.

### Stressor: Sea Urchin Grazing / "Urchin Barrens"

**Metric:** Sea urchin density (number of urchins per square meter); kelp cover (percentage); presence/absence of sea otters.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Underwater surveys (diver surveys, ROVs).
    *   Research studies (e.g., from universities in California).
    *   Long-term monitoring programs.

**Impact on Area:** Conversion of kelp forests to urchin barrens.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Dramatic reduction in biodiversity.
    *   Loss of habitat for many species.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Sea Otter Decline/Absence: Sea otters are a keystone predator of sea urchins. Their decline (historically due to hunting, now recovering in some areas) is a *major* factor.
    *   Overfishing of Other Urchin Predators: (e.g., sheephead fish, lobsters).
    *   Ocean Warming: Can favor urchin reproduction in some cases.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Kelp Forest Cover (primary impact).

**Logic Description:** The interplay between sea otters, sea urchins, and kelp is a classic example of a trophic cascade.  Without sufficient otter predation (or predation from other species), urchin populations can explode and overgraze kelp forests, leading to the formation of urchin barrens.

### Stressor: Water Pollution (from Runoff)

**Metric:** Concentrations of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus), sediments, and pollutants (e.g., pesticides) in coastal waters.

**Data Sources:**
    *   California State Water Resources Control Board monitoring data.
    *   Regional water quality monitoring programs.
    *   Research studies.

**Impact on Area:** Reduced water quality; increased turbidity.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Nutrient enrichment can lead to algal blooms that compete with kelp.
    *   Sedimentation reduces light penetration.
    *   Toxic pollutants can harm kelp and other organisms.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Agricultural Runoff.
    *   Urban Runoff.
    *   Deforestation (increased sediment runoff).

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Kelp Growth and Survival.
    *   Water Clarity.

**Logic Description:** Runoff from agriculture, urban areas, and deforested areas carries pollutants into coastal waters, reducing water quality and impacting kelp forest health.
