## Atlantic Forest (South America)

### Stressor: Infrastructure Development (Atlantic Forest)

**Metric:** Road length (km/year); area affected by other projects (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Government and industry reports.
    *   Remote sensing data.
    *   NGO reports.

**Impact on Area:** Direct loss and fragmentation (already highly fragmented).

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss and fragmentation.
    *   Increased access for hunting/poaching.
    * Edge effects

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Economic Growth.
    *   Population Growth (high population density in the region).
    *   Government Policies.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Deforestation.
    *   Wildfires.

**Logic Description:** Further fragmentation of an already highly fragmented ecosystem, increasing edge effects and isolating populations.

### Stressor: Deforestation (Atlantic Forest)

**Metric:** Area of forest cleared per year (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote sensing data.
    *   NGO and research reports.

**Impact on Area:** Direct reduction (already severely reduced).

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss.
    *   Increased extinction risk.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Infrastructure Development.
    *   Economic Growth: Agriculture (sugarcane, coffee, cattle).
    *   Urban Expansion.
    * Government Policies

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Wildfires.

**Logic Description:** Continued deforestation, driven by agriculture and urban expansion, further reduces the remaining fragments of this highly threatened ecosystem.

### Stressor: Temperature Increase (Atlantic Forest)

**Metric:** Average annual temperature increase (Â°C).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Global and regional climate models.
    *   Historical data.

**Impact on Area:** Indirect.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Species shifts.
    *   Physiological stress.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.
    *   Deforestation.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Wildfires.
    *   Changes in Precipitation.

**Logic Description:** Global warming impacts.

### Stressor: Changes in Precipitation (Atlantic Forest)

**Metric:** Change in annual precipitation (mm/year); dry season changes.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Climate models.
    *   Historical data.

**Impact on Area:** Indirect.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Species shifts.
    *   Drought stress.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.
    *   Deforestation (potentially).

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Wildfires.

**Logic Description:** Changes in rainfall patterns.

### Stressor: Wildfires (Atlantic Forest)

**Metric:** Number of wildfires per year; total area burned (hectares/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *  Remote sensing
    * Fire department and agency reports

**Impact on Area:** Direct loss within fragmented patches.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
  * Mortality
  * Habitat loss
  * Exacerbation of fragmentation.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
 * Deforestation
 * Temp increase
  * Precipitation changes
 * Human activities

**Influences (Stressors):**
 * Deforestation (further fragmentation).

**Logic Description:** Wildfires, often linked to ag practices and climate, degrade fragmented forest.
