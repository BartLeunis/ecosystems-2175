## Danube River

### Stressor: Pollution (Danube River)

**Metric:** Concentrations of pollutants (nutrients, heavy metals, organic pollutants, pharmaceuticals) in water, sediment, and biota.

**Data Sources:**
    *   International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR).
    *   National monitoring programs (of countries along the Danube).
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Widespread water quality degradation.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Eutrophication (nutrient enrichment).
    *   Toxic effects on aquatic organisms.
    *   Impacts on human health (through drinking water and fish consumption).
    *   Bioaccumulation of pollutants.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Agricultural Runoff: Fertilizers and animal waste.
    *   Industrial Discharge: Untreated or poorly treated industrial wastewater.
    *   Municipal Wastewater: Sewage from cities and towns.
    *   Mining Activities: Release of heavy metals.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Water Quality.
    *   Aquatic Life Health.
    *   Human Health.

**Logic Description:** The Danube River is a transboundary river flowing through many countries, and it receives pollution from a wide range of sources, including agriculture, industry, and urban areas. This pollution degrades water quality and impacts both aquatic life and human health.

### Stressor: Hydromorphological Alterations (Danube River)

**Metric:** Number of dams, weirs, and other structures; extent of channelization; loss of floodplain habitats; changes in flow regime.

**Data Sources:**
    *   ICPDR.
    *   National water management agencies.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Altered river morphology and hydrology; loss of natural habitats.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Impacts on fish migration (dams block passage).
    *   Loss of spawning grounds.
    *   Changes in invertebrate communities.
    *   Loss of floodplain wetlands and riparian habitats.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Hydropower Generation: Dams.
    *   Navigation: Channelization and locks.
    *   Flood Control: Levees and embankments.
    *   Water Abstraction: For irrigation and other uses.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Habitat Connectivity.
    *   Sediment Transport.
    *   Floodplain Ecosystems.
    *   Fish Migration

**Logic Description:** Dams, weirs, channelization, and other hydromorphological alterations have significantly changed the Danube River's natural flow regime, fragmenting habitats, blocking fish migration, and reducing the extent of floodplains.

### Stressor: Invasive Species
**Metric**: Distribution and abundance.

**Data Sources:**
 * Research
 * Monitoring programs.

**Impact on Area**: Changes to habitats.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
        *   Competition with native species.
        *   Alteration of food webs.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
 * Ballast water.
 * Canals
 * Climate Change

**Influences (Stressors):**
     * Native Species

**Logic Description:** Invasive species impact.

### Stressor: Climate Change

**Metric:** Temperature and precipitation changes

**Data Sources:**
        * Climate Models
        * Historical Data

**Impact on Area:** Altered flow and temperature

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
   * Species shifts
  * Increased Stress

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
        * Global GHG Emissions

**Influences (Stressors):**
  *  Hydrology

**Logic Description:** Climate change impacts.
