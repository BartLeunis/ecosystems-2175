## Murray-Darling Basin

### Stressor: Water Extraction (Murray-Darling Basin)

**Metric:** Volume of water extracted for irrigation and other uses (gigalitres/year); river flow rates; water levels in wetlands.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA).
    *   Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM).
    *   State government water agencies.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** *Significant* reduction in river flows; drying of wetlands; reduced environmental flows.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Decline of native fish populations.
    *   Impacts on waterbirds (breeding and feeding).
    *   Loss of wetland habitats.
    *   Degradation of riverine ecosystems.
    *   Increased salinity (in some areas).

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Irrigated Agriculture: The primary user of water in the basin.
    *   Government Water Policies: Water allocation and management.
    *   Climate Change: Reduced rainfall and increased evaporation.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Water Availability (the dominant impact).
    *   River Health.
    *   Wetland Extent.

**Logic Description:** Over-extraction of water, primarily for irrigated agriculture, is the *major* stressor on the Murray-Darling Basin, leading to drastically reduced river flows, the drying of wetlands, and widespread environmental degradation.

### Stressor: Altered Flow Regimes (Murray-Darling Basin)

**Metric:** Changes in the timing, duration, and magnitude of flow events; reduced frequency of floods.

**Data Sources:**
    *   MDBA.
    *   BOM.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Changes in river and wetland habitats.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Impacts on fish spawning and migration (many native fish need floods to trigger spawning).
    *   Loss of floodplain wetlands.
    *   Changes in vegetation communities.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Dams and Weirs: Regulate flow and reduce flood peaks.
    *   Water Extraction: Reduces overall flow.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Habitat Connectivity.
    *   Fish Breeding.
    *   Wetland Ecosystems.

**Logic Description:** Dams, weirs, and water extraction have altered the natural flow regime of the rivers, reducing the frequency and magnitude of floods, which are essential for many ecological processes.

### Stressor: Climate Change (Murray Darling)

**Metric:** Temperature increase; changes to precipiation, increased droughts

**Data Sources:**
 * Climate models
 * Historical data

**Impact on Area:** Reduced water availability

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
 * Increased stress
 * Species shifts

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
   * Global GHG

**Influences (Stressors):**
* Water availability
 * Fire Regimes

**Logic Description:** Climate change exacerbates water scarcity and increases temperatures.

### Stressor: Invasive Species (Murray-Darling Basin)

**Metric:** Distribution and abundance of key invasive species (e.g., common carp, *Salvinia molesta*).

**Data Sources**:
*Research studies, government reports

**Impact on Area:** Alters aquatic habitats

**Impact on Biodiversity**:
* Competition with and predation on native species.

**Influenced By (Stressors)**:
* Human Introductions
* Altered Hydrology

**Influences (Stressors)**:
* Native Fish
* Water Quality

**Logic Description:** Invasive species such as the common carp are a problem.

---
### Stressor: Pollution

**Metric**: Nutrient, pesticide, and salt levels in water.

**Data Sources:**
* Water Quality Monitoring

**Impact on Area:** Degraded water quality

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
* Impacts aquatic species, algal blooms.

**Influenced By:**
    * Agriculture
   * Urban runoff

**Influences (Stressors):**
        * Water Quality

**Logic Description**: Agricultural runoff and other pollution degrades water quality.

---
### Stressor: Salinity

**Metric**: Salt concentration in water and soil

**Data Sources:**
 * Monitoring programs

**Impact on Area:** Degraded soil and water

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
 * Impacts salt-sensitive species

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    * Irrigation
    * Land Clearing
     * Reduced Flows

**Influences (Stressors):**
      * Water quality
       * Soil health.

**Logic Description**: Dryland and irrigation-induced salinity are major problems.
