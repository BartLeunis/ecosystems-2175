## Andes Montane

### Stressor: Glacier Retreat (Andes)

**Metric:** Change in glacier area (km²) and volume (km³); glacier mass balance.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote sensing data (satellite imagery).
    *   Field measurements (where available).
    *   Research publications (e.g., from the *Instituto Nacional de Investigación en Glaciares y Ecosistemas de Montaña* (INAIGEM) in Peru, and similar institutions in other Andean countries).

**Impact on Area:** *Rapid and widespread* glacier loss; changes in water availability.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of habitat for glacier-dependent species.
    *   Changes in downstream water availability and temperature, affecting aquatic ecosystems.
    *   Increased risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs).

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Temperature Increase: The primary driver.
    *   Changes in Precipitation (in some areas).
    * Black Carbon

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Water Resources: *Critical* for downstream populations and agriculture.
    *   Hazard Risks (GLOFs).

**Logic Description:** The Andes are experiencing *very high* rates of glacier retreat, which is a *critical* issue for water resources in many Andean countries.  This is a major impact of climate change.

### Stressor: Land-Use Change (Deforestation and Agriculture - Andes)

**Metric:** Area deforested (ha/year); area converted to agriculture and pasture (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote sensing data.
    *   Government statistics (often incomplete).
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Habitat loss and fragmentation; soil erosion.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of habitat for *highly endemic* species.
    *   Increased human-wildlife conflict.
    *   Impacts on water quality.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Agricultural Expansion: Subsistence agriculture and commercial agriculture.
    *   Mining Activities.
    *   Population Growth.
    *   Logging (in some areas).

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Soil Erosion.
    *   Water Quality.
    *   Habitat Fragmentation

**Logic Description:** Deforestation and land-use change for agriculture and mining are significant threats, particularly given the high levels of endemism in the Andes.

### Stressor: Mining (Andes)

**Metric:** Area affected by mining operations; water use and pollution from mining.

**Data Sources:**
     * Government records
     * Research

**Impact on Area:** Habitat destruction, water pollution, and contamination.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
         * Impacts on sensitive ecosystems.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
     * Global demand for minerals

**Influences (Stressors):**
         * Water resources
         * Pollution

**Logic Description:** Mining is a major economic activity but also a significant environmental stressor.

---
### Stressor: Overgrazing
**Metric:** Livestock density.

**Data Sources:**
    * Agricultural statistics.

**Impact on Area:** Vegetation degradation.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
  * Impact on plant communities.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
*   Livestock management.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    * Desertification

**Logic Description:** Overgrazing impacts vegetation.

---
### Stressor: Climate Change

**Metric:** Temperature changes, precipitation changes, frequency of extreme events.

**Data Sources:**
  * Climate Models
   * Historical records

**Impact on Area:** Changes to ecosystems

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
  * Shifts in species distributions.
   * Increased stress

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
  * Global GHG

**Influences (Stressors):**
 * Water resources.

**Logic Description:** Climate change is a pervasive stressor.
