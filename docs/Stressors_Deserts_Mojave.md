## Mojave Desert

### Stressor: Urban Sprawl and Development

**Metric:** Area converted to urban areas, roads, and other infrastructure (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote sensing data.
    *   City and county planning documents (Las Vegas, etc.).
    *   USGS data.

**Impact on Area:** Habitat loss and fragmentation.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of habitat for desert species (e.g., desert tortoise).
    *   Increased human-wildlife conflict.
    *   Disruption of ecological processes.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Population Growth: In cities like Las Vegas.
    *   Urban Expansion.
    *   Infrastructure Development.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Habitat Fragmentation.

**Logic Description:** Urban sprawl and development, driven by population growth in cities like Las Vegas, are encroaching on Mojave Desert habitats.

### Stressor: Water Extraction

**Metric:** Volume of groundwater extracted (mÂ³/year); changes in groundwater levels.

**Data Sources:**
    *   USGS water resource data.
    *   State and local water agencies.

**Impact on Area:** Depletion of groundwater resources; impacts on springs and seeps.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of water sources for wildlife.
    *   Decline of vegetation dependent on groundwater.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Urban Water Demand.
    *   Agricultural Water Use (in some areas).
    *   Mining.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Water Availability.

**Logic Description:** Groundwater extraction is a significant concern, impacting desert water sources.

### Stressor: Off-Road Vehicle Use

**Metric:** Area affected by off-road vehicle use; density of trails.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Bureau of Land Management (BLM) data.
    *   Remote sensing.
    *   Research studies.

**Impact on Area:** Soil compaction; damage to vegetation; disturbance to wildlife.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Crushing of plants and animals.
    *   Soil erosion.
    *   Spread of invasive species.
    *   Disturbance to sensitive desert habitats (e.g., cryptobiotic soil crusts).

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Recreational Activities.
    *   Lack of Enforcement of Regulations.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Soil Erosion.
    *   Vegetation Damage.

**Logic Description:** Off-road vehicle use causes significant physical damage to desert soils and vegetation, impacting biodiversity.

### Stressor: Invasive Species (Mojave Desert)

**Metric:** Distribution and abundance of invasive plants (e.g., cheatgrass, red brome).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Vegetation surveys.
    *   Research studies.

**Impact on Area:** Changes in vegetation composition; increased fire frequency.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Competition with native desert plants.
    *   Altered fire regimes (invasive grasses can increase fire frequency and intensity).

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Disturbance: (e.g., off-road vehicle use, grazing).
    *   Climate Change: May favor some invasives.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Fire Regimes.
    *   Native Plant Communities.

**Logic Description:** Invasive plants, particularly annual grasses, are altering fire regimes and outcompeting native desert vegetation.

### Stressor: Climate Change (Mojave Desert)

**Metric:** Temperature increase; changes in precipitation.

**Data Sources:**
        * Climate models.
        * Historical records

**Impact on Area:** Increased aridity.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
        * Increased stress.
         * Species shifts.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
        * Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
 * Water availability

**Logic Description:** Climate change impacts.
