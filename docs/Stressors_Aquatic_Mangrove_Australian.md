## Australian Mangroves

### Stressor: Climate Change (Australian Mangroves)

**Metric:** Sea level rise (mm/year); sea surface temperature (Â°C); changes in precipitation patterns; increased storm intensity.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM).
    *   CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation).
    *   Climate models.
    *   Tide gauge records.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:**
    *   Coastal inundation and erosion due to sea level rise.
    *   Changes in salinity due to altered freshwater input.
    *   Increased damage from storms.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Shifts in mangrove species distributions.
    *   Increased stress on mangroves.
    *   Loss of mangrove habitat due to sea level rise.
    *   Changes in phenology.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Sea Level Rise.
    *   Coastal Erosion.
    *   Storm Surge.

**Logic Description:** Climate change, particularly sea level rise, poses a *major* threat to Australian mangroves. Increased storm intensity and changes in rainfall patterns also have impacts.

### Stressor: Coastal Development
**Metric:** Area converted

**Data Sources:**
    * Remote sensing
 * Government statistics

**Impact on Area:** Loss of habitat and fragmentation

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
 * Habitat Loss

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
     * Urban expansion
 * Infrastructure

**Influences (Stressors):**
         * Habitat Fragmentation

**Logic Description:** Coastal development is a pressure.

### Stressor: Pollution

**Metric:** Concentrations of pollutants.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Water quality monitoring programs.
    *   Research studies.

**Impact on Area:** Water quality degradation

**Impact on Biodiversity:** Impacts mangroves and associated species.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
  * Agricultural, urban, and industrial runoff

**Influences (Stressors):**
 * Mangrove Health

**Logic Description:** Runoff a concern in some areas.
