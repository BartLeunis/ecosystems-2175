## Gobi Desert

### Stressor: Climate Change (Gobi Desert)

**Metric:** Temperature increase (Â°C); changes in precipitation (mm/year, seasonality); increased frequency and severity of drought.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Climate models.
    *   Historical weather records.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Increased aridity; desertification.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Increased stress on desert-adapted species.
    *   Potential for local extinctions.
    *   Changes in species distributions.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Water Availability.
    *   Desertification.
    *   Dust Storms.

**Logic Description:** Climate change is exacerbating aridity and increasing the risk of desertification in the Gobi Desert.

### Stressor: Overgrazing (Gobi Desert)

**Metric:** Livestock density (number of animals per unit area); vegetation cover and composition; soil erosion.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Government statistics (Mongolia, China).
    *   Research publications.
    *   Remote sensing data.

**Impact on Area:** Degradation of vegetation; soil erosion; desertification.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of palatable plant species.
    *   Spread of unpalatable or invasive species.
    *   Impacts on wildlife that depend on native vegetation.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Livestock Management Practices: Overstocking.
    *   Population Growth: Increased demand for livestock products.
    *   Economic Factors.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Desertification: A *major* consequence.
    *   Dust Storms: Loss of vegetation cover increases dust storm frequency and intensity.

**Logic Description:** Overgrazing by livestock is a *major* driver of desertification in the Gobi Desert, leading to vegetation degradation, soil erosion, and loss of biodiversity.

### Stressor: Mining
**Metric**: Area affected by mining

**Data Sources:**
    * Government and Company reports

**Impact on Area:** Habitat Loss

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss and fragmentation.
  * Pollution

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
        * Demand for resources

**Influences (Stressors):**
 * Pollution

**Logic Description:** Mining activities impact.

### Stressor: Dust Storms (Gobi Desert)

**Metric:** Frequency and intensity of dust storms; visibility; particulate matter concentrations.

**Data Sources:**
        * Meteorological data.
        * Remote sensing data
        * Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Impacts on air quality, soil fertility, and human health *far beyond* the Gobi Desert itself.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Can damage vegetation.
    *   Can affect animal health.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
       * Desertification (loss of vegetation cover).
       * Overgrazing
       * Climate Change (changes in wind patterns, drought).

**Influences (Stressors):**
    * Air Quality (downwind).
     * Human Health (downwind).
     * Soil Fertility (in areas where dust is deposited).

**Logic Description:** The Gobi Desert is a major source of dust storms, which can have significant impacts on air quality, human health, and even soil fertility in downwind areas. Desertification and climate change are exacerbating the problem.
