## Eurasian Steppes

### Stressor: Land-Use Change (Eurasian Steppes)

**Metric:** Area converted to agriculture, settlements, or other land uses (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote sensing data.
    *   National government statistics (various countries across Eurasia).
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Loss of steppe habitat; fragmentation.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss and fragmentation.
    *   Decline of steppe-dependent species.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    * Eurasian Steppes - Agricultural Expansion
    * Eurasian Steppes - Population Growth
    * Eurasian Steppes - Government Policies

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *  Eurasian Steppes - Habitat Fragmentation

**Logic Description:** Conversion of steppe to agriculture, particularly large-scale agriculture, is a major threat, leading to habitat loss and fragmentation.

### Stressor: Habitat Fragmentation (Eurasian Steppes)

**Metric:** Patch size distribution; edge density; connectivity indices.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Land cover data (from remote sensing).
    *   GIS analysis.

**Impact on Area:** Remaining steppe exists in increasingly isolated patches.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Reduced gene flow.
    *   Increased edge effects.
    *   Limited dispersal ability.
    *   Increased vulnerability to stochastic events.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Eurasian Steppes - Land-Use Change

**Influences (Stressors):**
    * Exacerbates impacts of other stressors

**Logic Description:** Fragmentation isolates steppe patches, reducing their ecological viability.

### Stressor: Climate Change (Eurasian Steppes)

**Metric:** Temperature increase (Â°C); changes in precipitation (mm/year, seasonality); increased frequency and severity of drought.

**Data Sources:**
 * Climate models.
  * Historical data.

**Impact on Area:** Indirect; changes in growing conditions.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Shifts in species distributions.
    *   Increased stress on steppe species.
    *   Changes in phenology.
    *   Increased fire risk (in some areas).
    *   Desertification (in some areas).

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    * Global GHG

**Influences (Stressors):**
     *  Eurasian Steppes - Fire Regimes
      *  Eurasian Steppes - Water Availability.

**Logic Description:** Climate change is altering temperature and precipitation patterns, increasing aridity and the risk of desertification in some areas.

### Stressor: Overgrazing (Eurasian Steppes)

**Metric:** Livestock density; vegetation cover and composition; soil erosion.
**Data Sources:**
  * Agricultural Statistics
  * Vegetation surveys
  * Remote sensing

**Impact on Area:** Changes in vegetation structure; soil degradation.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
  * Loss of palatable species
  * Soil Compaction
  * Spread of unpalatable plants.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
  *  Eurasian Steppes - Livestock Management

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *  Eurasian Steppes - Vegetation Changes
    *  Eurasian Steppes - Desertification (in extreme cases).

**Logic Description:** Overgrazing by livestock is a widespread problem, leading to vegetation degradation and soil erosion.

### Stressor: Wildfires (Eurasian Steppes)

**Metric:** Fire frequency; area burned (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote sensing data.
    *   Government statistics (various countries).

**Impact on Area:** Changes in vegetation structure and composition.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
 * Can be beneficial for some steppe species if fire regimes are natural, but increased frequency or intensity due to climate change or human activities can be detrimental.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
 *  Eurasian Steppes - Climate Change
  * Human activities.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *  Eurasian Steppes - Vegetation Structure.

**Logic Description:** Changes in fire regimes, often linked to human activities and climate change, can impact steppe ecosystems.
---
### Stressor: Invasive Species (Eurasian Steppes)
**Metric:** Distribution and abundance of key invasive species.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Vegetation surveys.
    *   Research studies.

**Impact on Area:** Changes in vegetation composition.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
   * Competition
    * Altered processes

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
 *  Eurasian Steppes - Disturbance
  *  Eurasian Steppes - Climate Change

**Influences (Stressors):**
        *  Eurasian Steppes - Native Communities

**Logic Description:** Invasive species impacts.
