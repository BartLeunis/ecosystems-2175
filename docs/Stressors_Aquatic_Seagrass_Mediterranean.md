## Mediterranean Seagrass (*Posidonia oceanica*)

### Stressor: Physical Damage (Anchoring and Trawling)

**Metric:** Area of *Posidonia oceanica* meadows damaged by anchoring and trawling (ha/year); density of boat anchors in seagrass areas.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Underwater surveys (using divers, ROVs, and sonar).
    *   Mapping of seagrass meadows.
    *   Boating activity data.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Direct destruction of *Posidonia oceanica* meadows; fragmentation. *Posidonia* is *extremely* slow-growing, so damage is long-lasting.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of habitat for a wide range of species.
    *   Reduced nursery grounds for fish.
    *   Increased coastal erosion (Posidonia meadows stabilize sediments).

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Boating Activity: Anchoring in seagrass meadows.
    *   Illegal Trawling: Trawling is prohibited in many areas, but illegal trawling still occurs.
    *   Coastal Development.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Habitat Loss (the primary impact).
    *   Coastal Erosion.

**Logic Description:** Physical damage from anchoring and (illegal) trawling is a *major* threat to *Posidonia oceanica* meadows.  These meadows are extremely slow-growing and recover very slowly from damage, so the impacts can last for decades or centuries.

### Stressor: Water Quality Degradation

**Metric:** Water clarity (turbidity); nutrient concentrations; concentrations of pollutants.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Water quality monitoring programs.
    *   Research studies.

**Impact on Area:** Reduced light penetration; stress on *Posidonia*.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Reduced seagrass growth and survival.
    *   Algal blooms.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Urban Runoff: Sewage, stormwater.
    *   Agricultural Runoff.
    *   Industrial Discharge.
    *   Coastal Development.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Light Availability.
    *   Seagrass Health.

**Logic Description:** Reduced water quality due to pollution and increased turbidity is a significant threat.

### Stressor: Climate Change (Mediterranean)

**Metric:** Sea surface temperature; frequency/intensity of heatwaves; ocean acidification.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Climate models.
        * Oceanographic data.

**Impact on Area:**
         *   Increased *Posidonia* mortality (especially during heatwaves).

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
        * Shifts in species distributions.
        *   Increased stress on *Posidonia* and associated species.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
        *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
         *   Heat Stress.
    * Ocean Acidification

**Logic Description:** The Mediterranean Sea is warming rapidly, and marine heatwaves are becoming more frequent and intense, posing a significant threat to *Posidonia oceanica*.

### Stressor: Invasive Species
**Metric:** Distribution and abundance of invasive *Caulerpa* species.

**Data Sources:**
        * Underwater surveys.
        * Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Competition with *Posidonia*.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
         * Can outcompete *Posidonia* and alter habitat structure.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
         *   Shipping (ballast water, hull fouling).
         *   Aquarium releases.
* Climate Change

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *  Native Seagrass

**Logic Description:** Invasive algae, particularly *Caulerpa* species, can outcompete *Posidonia oceanica*.
