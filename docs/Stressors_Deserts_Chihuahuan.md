## Chihuahuan Desert

### Stressor: Overgrazing

**Metric:** Livestock density; vegetation cover and composition; soil erosion.

**Data Sources:**
    *   US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) data (for public lands).
    *   Mexican government data.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Degradation of vegetation; soil erosion; shrub encroachment.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of palatable grasses and forbs.
    *   Changes in plant community composition.
    *   Impacts on wildlife that depend on grasslands.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Livestock Management Practices: Overstocking.
    *   Land Tenure Systems.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Desertification.
    *   Shrub Encroachment.

**Logic Description:** Overgrazing by livestock is a *widespread* problem in the Chihuahuan Desert, leading to vegetation degradation, soil erosion, and shifts in plant communities.

### Stressor: Water Extraction

**Metric:** Volume of groundwater extracted (mÂ³/year); changes in groundwater levels; impacts on springs.

**Data Sources:**
    *   USGS water resource data.
    *   Mexican government data.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Depletion of groundwater; loss of water sources.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Impacts on riparian habitats and springs, which are crucial for many desert species.
    *   Increased stress on vegetation.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Agricultural Water Use.
    *   Urban Water Demand.
    *   Mining Activities.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Water Availability.

**Logic Description:** Groundwater extraction for agriculture, urban use, and mining is a significant concern, impacting water availability for desert ecosystems.

### Stressor: Land-Use Change

**Metric:** Area converted to agriculture, urban development, or other uses (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
     * Remote Sensing
      * Government

**Impact on Area:** Habitat loss and fragmentation.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
        *   Loss of habitat.
        *   Disruption of ecological processes.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
     * Agricultural expansion
     * Urban sprawl

**Influences (Stressors):**
      * Fragmentation.

**Logic Description:** Conversion of desert habitat to other land uses.

### Stressor: Invasive Species

**Metric:** Distribution and abundance of key invasive species (e.g., Lehmann lovegrass).

**Data Sources:**
        * Vegetation surveys
        * Research.

**Impact on Area:** Changes in vegetation composition and structure; altered fire regimes (in some cases).

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
         * Competition
          * Altered fire.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Disturbance (e.g., overgrazing).

**Influences (Stressors):**
 * Native Plants
* Fire

**Logic Description:** Invasive plants can outcompete natives and alter fire regimes.

### Stressor: Climate Change

**Metric:** Temperature increase; changes in precipitation; increased drought.

**Data Sources:**
 * Climate models.
 * Historical Data.

**Impact on Area:** Increased aridity

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
        * Stress on species.
         * Distribution changes.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
 * Global GHG

**Influences (Stressors):**
         * Water Availability.

**Logic Description:** Climate change will exacerbate aridity and water stress.
