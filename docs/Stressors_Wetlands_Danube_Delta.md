## Danube Delta (Romania/Ukraine)

### Stressor: Altered Hydrology (Danube Delta)

**Metric:** Water levels in the Danube River and in the delta's channels and lakes; water flow rates; sediment load.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Romanian and Ukrainian government agencies responsible for water management.
    *   Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve Authority (Romania).
    *   Research institutions (e.g., Danube Delta National Institute for Research and Development).
    *   International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR).

**Impact on Area:** Changes in the extent and distribution of different wetland habitats (reed beds, floating reed islands, lakes, channels).

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Impacts on fish populations (spawning, migration â€“ the delta is *very* important for fish).
    *   Changes in bird populations (breeding, feeding, migration).
    *   Impacts on aquatic invertebrate communities.
    *   Changes in vegetation communities.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Upstream Dam Construction: Dams on the Danube River and its tributaries (throughout the Danube Basin) significantly alter flow regimes and sediment transport.
    *   Water Management Practices: Within the delta itself (e.g., canals, dikes).
    *   Climate Change: Changes in precipitation and river discharge.
    * Navigation projects

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Sedimentation.
    *   Habitat Availability.
    *   Water Quality.

**Logic Description:** The Danube Delta's hydrology is strongly influenced by the Danube River. Upstream dams, water management practices within the delta, and climate change are all altering the natural hydrological regime, with significant impacts on the ecosystem.

### Stressor: Pollution (Danube Delta)

**Metric:** Concentrations of pollutants (e.g., nutrients, heavy metals, pesticides, organic pollutants) in water, sediment, and biota.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Water quality monitoring programs (Romanian and Ukrainian agencies, ICPDR).
    *   Research studies.

**Impact on Area:** Degradation of water quality.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Eutrophication (nutrient enrichment, leading to algal blooms).
    *   Toxic effects on wildlife.
    *   Impacts on food webs.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Agricultural Runoff: From the Danube River Basin (a *huge* area).
    *   Industrial Discharge: From industries throughout the basin.
    *   Untreated or Inadequately Treated Wastewater: From cities and towns along the Danube.
    * Navigation

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Water Quality.
    *   Wildlife Health.

**Logic Description:** The Danube Delta receives pollutants from the entire Danube River Basin, a vast area encompassing many countries. Agriculture, industry, and inadequate wastewater treatment are major sources.

### Stressor: Invasive Species (Danube Delta)

**Metric:** Abundance and distribution of key invasive species (e.g., certain fish, mollusks, plants).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Research studies.
    *   Monitoring programs by the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve Authority.

**Impact on Area:** Changes in species composition and ecosystem structure.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Competition with native species.
    *   Predation on native species.
    *   Alteration of habitat.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Introduction through shipping (ballast water).
    *   Aquaculture (escaped fish).
    * Climate Change (may favor some invasives)

**Influences (Stressors):**
     * Native Species

**Logic Description:** Invasive species, introduced through various pathways, can outcompete native species and disrupt the delta's ecosystem.

---
### Stressor: Overfishing (Danube Delta)
**Metric:** Fish catches, population sizes.

**Data Sources:**
  * Fishery statistics
  * Research

**Impact on Area:** N/A

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
   * Decline in fish populations.
   * Food web effects

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
     * Fishing pressure

**Influences (Stressors):**
  * Fish Stocks
  * Food Webs

**Logic Description:** Unsustainable fishing practices impact fish.

### Stressor: Climate Change (Danube Delta)
**Metric:** Temp, precip, sea level rise.

**Data Sources:**
  * Climate Models.
    * Historical Records

**Impact on Area:** Changes in hydro, coastal erosion.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
  * Species shifts, stress.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    * Global GHG

**Influences (Stressors):**
 * Hydrology

**Logic Description**: Climate change is a long-term threat.

### Stressor: Eutrophication (Danube Delta)
**Metric:** Nutrient levels, algal blooms

**Data Sources:**
     * Water quality data.

**Impact on Area:** Water quality degradation

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
 * Harmful algal blooms, oxygen depletion.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
 * Danube Delta - Pollution

**Influences (Stressors):**
        * Danube Delta - Water Quality

**Logic Description:** Excess nutrients lead to algal overgrowth.

---
### Stressor: Navigation Projects (Danube Delta)

**Metric**: Dredging activity, canal construction.

**Data Sources:**
  * Government records, project reports.
**Impact on Area**: Altered hydrology, habitat loss.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
  * Direct habitat destruction, impacts on fish migration.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *  Economic development, international agreements.
**Influences (Stressors):**
    * Danube Delta - Altered Hydrology
