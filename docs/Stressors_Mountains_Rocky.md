## Rocky Mountains

### Stressor: Wildfires (Rocky Mountains)

**Metric:** Fire frequency; fire intensity; area burned; fire season length.

**Data Sources:**
    *   US Forest Service data.
    *   Canadian Forest Service data.
    *   Remote sensing data.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** *Large-scale* changes in forest structure and composition; increased erosion.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of habitat for some species.
    *   Creation of habitat for other species (fire-adapted species).
    *   Increased risk of invasive species establishment.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Climate Change: Hotter, drier conditions increase fire risk.
    *   Forest Management Practices: Fire suppression has led to a buildup of fuels in some areas.
    *   Insect Outbreaks: (e.g., mountain pine beetle) can create large areas of dead trees, increasing fire risk.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Forest Structure.
    *   Biodiversity.
    *   Water Quality (erosion).
    *   Air Quality

**Logic Description:** Wildfires are a *major* and increasing stressor in the Rocky Mountains, driven by climate change, forest management practices, and insect outbreaks.

### Stressor: Insect Outbreaks (Rocky Mountains)

**Metric:** Area affected by mountain pine beetle and other bark beetles; tree mortality.

**Data Sources:**
    *   US Forest Service data.
    *   Canadian Forest Service data.
    *   Aerial surveys.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** *Widespread* tree mortality.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of forest habitat.
    *   Changes in forest structure and composition.
    *   Increased risk of wildfires.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Climate Change: Warmer winters allow more beetles to survive.
    *   Drought Stress: Weakens trees and makes them more susceptible to attack.
    *   Forest Management Practices: Dense, even-aged forests are more vulnerable.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Forest Structure.
    *   Wildfire Risk.
    *   Water Resources (changes in snowpack and runoff).

**Logic Description:** Insect outbreaks, particularly mountain pine beetle, have caused *massive* tree mortality in the Rocky Mountains, driven by climate change and forest conditions.

### Stressor: Climate Change (Rocky Mts)

**Metric:** Temperature increase; changes in snowpack; changes in precipitation.

**Data Sources:**
     * Climate models.
 * Historical Records

**Impact on Area:** Changes to ecosystems

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
 * Shifts in distributions.
 * Increased stress

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
  * Global GHG

**Influences (Stressors):**
  * Water, fires, insects

**Logic Description:** Climate change is a major driver of many stressors.

### Stressor: Resource Extraction (Rocky Mts)
**Metric:** Area affected by mining and logging; pollution levels.

**Data Sources:**
     * Government records
     * Research

**Impact on Area:** Habitat loss and fragmentation; pollution.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
     * Direct and indirect impacts on species.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
      * Demand for resources.

**Influences (Stressors):**
      * Habitat loss
      * Pollution

**Logic Description:** Resource extraction continues to be a stressor.
