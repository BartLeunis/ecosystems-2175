## Sahara Desert

### Stressor: Climate Change (Sahara Desert)

**Metric:** Temperature increase (°C); changes in precipitation (mm/year, seasonality); increased frequency and severity of drought; increased frequency of extreme heat events.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Climate models (global and regional).
    *   Historical weather records (often sparse in desert regions).
    *   Remote sensing data.

**Impact on Area:** Indirect; changes in water availability, potentially leading to desertification and expansion of desert areas. *Expansion of the Sahara is a major concern.*

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Increased stress on desert-adapted species, potentially exceeding their tolerance limits.
    *   Changes in species distributions (shifts towards areas with more favorable conditions, if possible).
    *   Increased risk of local extinctions.
    *   Impacts on water sources (springs, oases), affecting wildlife.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions: The primary driver.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Water Availability: Further reduces already scarce water resources.
    *   Desertification: *Expansion of the desert is a major concern.*
    *   Dust Storms: May increase in frequency and intensity.

**Logic Description:**  The Sahara is already extremely hot and dry. Climate change is projected to make it even hotter and, in some areas, drier, exacerbating desertification and impacting the already limited biodiversity.  *Dust storms originating in the Sahara can have far-reaching impacts.*

### Stressor: Water Extraction (Sahara Desert)

**Metric:** Volume of groundwater extracted (m³/year); changes in groundwater levels (meters).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Governmental water resource agencies (where available - data may be limited).
    *   Research studies.
    *   Remote sensing (in some cases).

**Impact on Area:** Depletion of groundwater resources; loss of oases.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of water sources for wildlife.
    *   Decline of vegetation dependent on groundwater.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Population Growth: Increased demand for water.
    *   Agricultural Expansion: Irrigation projects (often unsustainable in the long term).

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Water Availability: Directly impacts water resources.

**Logic Description:** Groundwater extraction, often for agriculture, can deplete aquifers and threaten oases, which are critical habitats in the Sahara.

### Stressor: Desertification

**Metric**: Rate of desert expansion, soil degradation indicators.

**Data Sources:**
         * Remote sensing.
         * Research studies.

**Impact on Area:** Expansion of desert area.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
        *   Loss of habitat.
        *   Shifts in species composition.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
        *   Climate Change.
       * Overgrazing.
      * Unsustainable water use.
        *   Deforestation (in transition zones).

**Influences (Stressors):**
       * Further exacerbates climate change impacts.

**Logic Description:** The Sahara is expanding, driven by climate and human activities.
