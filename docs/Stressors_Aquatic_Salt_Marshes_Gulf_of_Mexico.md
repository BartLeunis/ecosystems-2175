## Gulf of Mexico Salt Marshes

### Stressor: Sea Level Rise and Subsidence

**Metric:** Rate of relative sea level rise (mm/year); marsh elevation; accretion rates.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Tide gauges (NOAA).
    *   Satellite altimetry.
    *   Sediment cores.
    *   USGS data.
    * Research

**Impact on Area:**
    *   *Very high* rates of marsh loss, particularly in Louisiana.
    *   Inundation and submergence.
    *   Erosion.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Extensive habitat loss.
    *   Species shifts.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.
    *   Land Subsidence: *Extremely* significant in Louisiana due to sediment compaction, fluid withdrawal, and faulting.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Coastal Erosion.
    *   Habitat Loss (the dominant impact).

**Logic Description:** The combination of sea level rise and *high rates of land subsidence* makes the Gulf Coast, *especially Louisiana*, extremely vulnerable to marsh loss. This is one of the highest rates of coastal wetland loss in the world.

### Stressor: Altered Hydrology and Sediment Deprivation

**Metric:** Changes in freshwater and sediment inflow; presence of levees and canals.

**Data Sources:**
    *   USGS river gauge data.
    *   US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) data.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:**
    *   Reduced sediment delivery to marshes (especially in Louisiana).
    *   Changes in salinity.
    *   Marsh degradation and loss.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss.
    *   Shifts in plant communities.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Mississippi River Levees: Prevent sediment from reaching marshes.
    *   Canals and Dredging: Alter hydrology and can lead to saltwater intrusion.
    *   Upstream Dams and Diversions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Sedimentation (or lack thereof).
    *   Salinity.
    *   Habitat Loss.

**Logic Description:** The levee system on the Mississippi River, while providing flood protection, prevents the natural deposition of sediment that is crucial for building and maintaining Louisiana's coastal marshes. This sediment deprivation, combined with sea level rise and subsidence, is the primary driver of land loss.

### Stressor: Oil Spills

**Metric:** Frequency and size of oil spills; amount of oil reaching marshes.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM).
    *   NOAA.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Direct oiling of marshes; contamination of sediments.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Toxic effects on plants and animals.
    *   Long-term contamination of sediments.
    *   Mortality

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Oil and Gas Extraction: The Gulf of Mexico is a major oil and gas producing region.
    *   Shipping.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Marsh Health.
    *   Wildlife Mortality.

**Logic Description:** Oil spills, both large (like Deepwater Horizon) and small, pose a recurring threat to Gulf Coast salt marshes.

### Stressor: Pollution (Nutrient Enrichment)

**Metric:** Concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in water.

**Data Sources:**
* EPA
 * State agencies.

**Impact on Area:** Eutrophication

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Altered plant communities.
    *   Can weaken plant roots, making marshes more vulnerable to erosion.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
  * Agricultural Runoff (from the Mississippi River watershed).
* Urban Runoff

**Influences (Stressors):**
   * Marsh health and stability.

**Logic Description:** Nutrient pollution, primarily from agricultural runoff carried by the Mississippi River, can impact marsh vegetation.
