## East African Mangroves (Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, Madagascar)

### Stressor: Deforestation (East Africa)

**Metric:** Area of mangroves cleared per year (ha/year) (primarily for charcoal and fuelwood).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote sensing data.
    *   Forestry data (often limited).
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** *Significant* loss of mangrove habitat.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss.
    *   Reduced carbon sequestration.
    *   Loss of coastal protection.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Poverty and Lack of Alternative Livelihoods: High dependence on mangrove wood for fuel.
    *   Demand for Charcoal: A major cooking fuel in the region.
    *   Population Growth: Increased demand for fuelwood.
    *   Weak Enforcement of Environmental Regulations.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Coastal Erosion.
    *   Carbon Emissions.

**Logic Description:** Deforestation for charcoal production and fuelwood is a *major* driver of mangrove loss in East Africa, driven by poverty, population growth, and lack of alternative energy sources.

### Stressor: Coastal Development

**Metric:** Area of mangroves converted to other land uses (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote sensing data.
    *   Government statistics.
    *   Reports from conservation organizations.

**Impact on Area:** Loss of mangrove habitat; fragmentation.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss.
    *   Reduced nursery grounds for fish.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Tourism Development: In some areas.
    *   Urbanization: Expansion of coastal towns and cities.
    *   Infrastructure Development (ports).
    *   Aquaculture (but less so than in SE Asia)

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Coastal Erosion.
    *   Water Quality.

**Logic Description:** Coastal development, while less extensive than in some other regions, is a growing threat.

### Stressor: Pollution

**Metric:** Concentrations of pollutants in water and sediment.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Water quality monitoring data (limited).
    *   Research studies.

**Impact on Area:** Water quality degradation.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Impacts on mangroves and associated fauna.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Urban Runoff.
    *   Industrial Discharge (in some areas).
    *   Agricultural Runoff.

**Influences (Stressors):**
        * Water Quality
        * Mangrove Health

**Logic Description:** Pollution from various sources impacts water quality.

### Stressor: Climate Change (East African Mangroves)

**Metric:** Sea Level Rise, temperature increase, changes in rainfall

**Data Sources:**
* Climate Models
* Tide Gauges
* Historical Weather Records

**Impact on Area:** Inundation and erosion, salinity changes

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
* Species shifts
* Increased Stress on mangroves

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
 * Global GHG

**Influences (Stressors):**
    * Sea Level
   * Coastal erosion

**Logic Description:** Climate change, particularly sea level rise.
