## North Atlantic Kelp Forests

### Stressor: Ocean Warming

**Metric:** Sea surface temperature (SST) (Â°C); frequency and severity of marine heatwaves; Degree Heating Weeks (DHW).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Satellite data
    *   In-situ temperature loggers.
    *   Climate models.

**Impact on Area:** Reduced kelp growth and survival; kelp forest die-offs during extreme events.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of habitat for many fish, invertebrates, and marine mammals.
    *   Changes in community structure (shift towards more warm-tolerant species).
    *   Increased vulnerability to other stressors.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Primary driver.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Sea Urchin Barrens Formation (see below).

**Logic Description:** Rising ocean temperatures, particularly during marine heatwaves, can stress kelp, leading to reduced growth, increased mortality, and even large-scale die-offs.

### Stressor: Invasive Species

**Metric:** Distribution and abundance of key invasive species (e.g.,  *Membranipora membranacea*, a bryozoan).

**Data Sources:**

    *   Underwater surveys.
    *   Research publications

**Impact on Area**: Impacts on kelp health and survival.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
   * *Membranipora* encrusts kelp blades, reducing their ability to photosynthesize and making them more susceptible to breakage.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
     * Shipping (ballast water, hull fouling).

**Influences (Stressors):**
 * Kelp health and survival

**Logic Description:** The invasive bryozoan *Membranipora membranacea* is a significant threat to kelp forests in some parts of the North Atlantic, encrusting kelp blades and reducing their photosynthetic capacity.

### Stressor: Storms and Wave Action

**Metric:** Wave Height, storm frequency

**Data Sources:**
     * Buoy Data
      * Weather records.
       * Climate Models

**Impact on Area:** Physical damage/removal of kelp.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
 * Loss of habitat
  * Disturbance

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
     * Climate Change
      * Weather Patterns

**Influences (Stressors):**
      * Kelp forest structure

**Logic Description:** Increased storm intensity or frequency, potentially linked to climate change, can cause physical damage to kelp forests.

### Stressor: Pollution
**Metric:** Water quality

**Data Sources:**
     * Monitoring
     * Research

**Impact on Area:** Impact on Kelp growth

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
 * Impacts to kelp and associated organisms

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    * Runoff, industrial discharge

**Influences (Stressors):**
  * Kelp growth

**Logic Description:** Water pollution can impact
