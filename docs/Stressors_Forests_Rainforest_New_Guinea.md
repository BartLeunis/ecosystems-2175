## New Guinea Rainforest

### Stressor: Infrastructure Development (New Guinea Rainforest)

**Metric:** Length of new roads (km/year); area affected by mining and other projects (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Government and industry reports.
    *   Remote sensing data.
    *   NGO reports.

**Impact on Area:** Direct loss and fragmentation.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss and fragmentation.
    *   Increased access for hunting/poaching.
    *   Disruption of ecological corridors.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Economic Growth: Resource extraction (mining, logging).
    *   Population Growth.
    *   Government Policies.
    *   Global Commodity Prices.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Deforestation.
    *   Wildfires.
    *   Pollution (from mining).

**Logic Description:** Similar to other rainforests, infrastructure development drives habitat loss and facilitates other stressors. Mining is a particularly significant threat in New Guinea.

### Stressor: Deforestation (New Guinea Rainforest)

**Metric:** Area of forest cleared per year (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote sensing data.
    *   NGO and research reports.

**Impact on Area:** Direct reduction.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss and fragmentation.
    *   Carbon emissions.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Infrastructure Development.
    *   Economic Growth: Palm oil, logging, mining.
    *   Global Commodity Prices.
    *   Population Growth.
    *   Government Policies.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Wildfires.

**Logic Description:** Deforestation, driven largely by palm oil expansion, logging, and mining, is a major threat.

### Stressor: Temperature Increase (New Guinea Rainforest)

**Metric:** Average annual temperature increase (Â°C).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Global and regional climate models.
    *   Limited historical data.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Species shifts.
    *   Physiological stress.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.
    *   Deforestation.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Wildfires.
    *   Changes in Precipitation.

**Logic Description:**  Global warming impacts, exacerbated by local deforestation.

### Stressor: Changes in Precipitation (New Guinea Rainforest)

**Metric:** Change in annual precipitation (mm/year); dry season changes.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Climate models.
    *   Limited historical data.

**Impact on Area:** Indirect.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Species shifts.
    *   Drought stress.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.
    *   Deforestation (potentially).

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Wildfires.

**Logic Description:** Changes in rainfall patterns, linked to climate change.

### Stressor: Wildfires (New Guinea Rainforest)

**Metric:** Number of fires; area burned (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote sensing.
    *   Local reports.

**Impact on Area:** Direct loss.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Mortality.
    *   Habitat loss.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Deforestation.
    *   Temperature Increase.
    *   Changes in Precipitation.
    *   Human Activities (land clearing).

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Deforestation.

**Logic Description:**  Fires, often linked to land clearing and exacerbated by climate change.

### Stressor: Mining
**Metric:** Area affected by mining; pollution levels.
**Data Sources:**
 * Government and company records.
 * Remote Sensing
 * Research
**Impact on Area:** Direct habitat loss; pollution.
**Impact on Biodiversity:**
 * Habitat loss.
* Toxic effects.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
 * Global demand for minerals

**Influences (Stressors):**
     * Pollution
     * Habitat loss

**Logic Description**: Mining operations cause pollution and habitat destruction.
