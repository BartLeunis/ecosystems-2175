## Coral Triangle

### Stressor: Destructive Fishing Practices

**Metric:** Frequency of blast fishing, cyanide fishing, and other destructive practices; area of reef damaged.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Underwater surveys.
    *   Reports from local communities and conservation organizations.
    *   Law enforcement data (often limited).

**Impact on Area:** Direct physical damage to coral reefs.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Coral mortality.
    *   Loss of reef structure.
    *   Decline of fish populations.
    *   Impacts on other reef organisms.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Poverty and Lack of Economic Opportunities.
    *   Weak Law Enforcement.
    *   Demand for Reef Fish (food and aquarium trade).
    *   Lack of Awareness: Of the impacts of these practices.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Coral Reef Structure and Health.

**Logic Description:** Destructive fishing practices, including blast fishing (using explosives) and cyanide fishing, are *widespread* in the Coral Triangle and cause severe damage to coral reefs and their associated biodiversity.

### Stressor: Overfishing

**Metric:** Fish biomass, size structure, and abundance of target species; catch per unit effort.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Fisheries data (often incomplete).
    *   Underwater surveys.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Not directly applicable, but affects ecosystem structure.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Decline of important fish species.
    *   Disruption of the food web.
    *   Loss of top predators.
    *   Potential for algal overgrowth (if herbivores are removed).

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   High Fishing Pressure: Due to large coastal populations and dependence on fishing.
    *   Weak Enforcement of Fisheries Regulations.
    *   Lack of Alternative Livelihoods.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Algal Overgrowth.
    *   Coral Reef Health.
    * Food web

**Logic Description:** Overfishing is a major and widespread threat in the Coral Triangle, depleting fish populations and disrupting the ecological balance of reef ecosystems.

### Stressor: Water Pollution

**Metric:** Concentrations of nutrients, sediments, and pollutants in coastal waters.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Water quality monitoring programs (often limited).
    *   Research studies.

**Impact on Area:** Reduced water quality.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Algal overgrowth.
    *   Reduced light penetration.
    *   Direct harm to corals and other organisms.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Agricultural Runoff: Fertilizers and pesticides.
    *   Deforestation: Increased sediment runoff.
    *   Urban Runoff: Sewage and industrial effluent.
    *   Mining Activities: Release of heavy metals and other pollutants.
    *   Inadequate Waste Management.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Coral Reef Health.
    *   Algal Blooms.

**Logic Description:** Pollution from various sources, including agriculture, deforestation, urbanization, and mining, degrades water quality and impacts coral reefs.

### Stressor: Coastal Development

**Metric:** Area of coastline developed (km or ha); population density in coastal areas.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Government statistics.
    *   Remote sensing data.
    *   Reports from conservation organizations.

**Impact on Area:** Habitat loss (mangroves, seagrass beds); increased sedimentation and pollution.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of critical habitats.
    *   Reduced water quality.
    *   Physical damage to reefs.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Population Growth: Rapid population growth in many coastal areas.
    *   Tourism Development.
    *   Urbanization.
    *   Infrastructure Development.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Water Quality.
    *   Sedimentation.
    *   Habitat Loss.

**Logic Description:** Rapid population growth and coastal development are leading to habitat loss, increased sedimentation, and pollution, impacting coral reefs.

### Stressor: Climate Change (Coral Triangle)

**Metric:** Sea surface temperature (SST) (Â°C); ocean acidification (pH); frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Climate models.
    *   Oceanographic data.
    *   Historical records.

**Impact on Area:** Coral bleaching; reduced coral growth rates.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Coral mortality (from bleaching).
    *   Shifts in coral species composition.
    *   Impacts on fish and invertebrate communities.
    *   Increased vulnerability to disease.
    * Acidification impacts

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Coral Bleaching.
    *   Ocean Acidification.
    *   Storm Damage.

**Logic Description:** Climate change, including warming waters, ocean acidification, and potentially increased storm intensity, poses a significant threat to coral reefs in the Coral Triangle.
