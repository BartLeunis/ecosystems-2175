**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Water Pollution: Poor water quality can increase coral susceptibility to disease.
    *   Ocean Warming: Warmer waters can exacerbate disease outbreaks.
    *   Other Stressors:  Any stressor that weakens corals can make them more vulnerable.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Coral Cover.
    *   Reef Resilience.

**Logic Description:** Coral diseases, often exacerbated by poor water quality and warming temperatures, have caused significant coral mortality and decline in the Florida Keys. Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease (SCTLD) has been particularly devastating.

### Stressor: Ocean Warming and Bleaching

**Metric:** Sea surface temperature (SST); frequency and severity of bleaching events; Degree Heating Weeks (DHW).

**Data Sources:**
    *   NOAA Coral Reef Watch.
    *   FKNMS monitoring data.
    *   Research publications.

**Impact on Area:** Coral bleaching; reduced coral growth rates.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Coral mortality (if bleaching is severe or prolonged).
    *   Shifts in coral species composition.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Coral Disease (bleached corals are more susceptible).
    *   Reef Resilience.

**Logic Description:** Rising ocean temperatures, driven by climate change, cause coral bleaching, which can lead to coral mortality and impact the overall health of the reef.

### Stressor: Physical Damage (Boats and Divers)

**Metric:** Number of boat groundings; diver contacts with corals; anchor damage.

**Data Sources:**
    *   FKNMS reports.
    *   Observations by researchers and dive operators.

**Impact on Area:** Direct physical damage to corals.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Coral breakage and mortality.
    *   Loss of reef structure.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   High Boating Traffic: In popular reef areas.
    *   Lack of Awareness: Among boaters and divers.
    *   Inadequate Mooring Buoys.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Coral Cover (localized impacts).

**Logic Description:** Physical damage from boat anchors, groundings, and diver/snorkeler contact can cause localized but significant damage to corals.
