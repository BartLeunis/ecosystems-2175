## Florida Bay/Gulf of Mexico Seagrass

### Stressor: Water Quality Degradation (Florida/Gulf)

**Metric:** Water clarity (turbidity); nutrient concentrations (nitrogen, phosphorus); salinity; chlorophyll *a* concentrations.

**Data Sources:**
    *   South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) monitoring data.
    *   Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) data.
    *   EPA data.
    *   Research studies.

**Impact on Area:** *Widespread* seagrass loss due to reduced light penetration and algal blooms.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Massive seagrass die-offs (have occurred repeatedly in Florida Bay).
    *   Loss of habitat for fish, invertebrates, and endangered species like manatees.
    *   Altered food webs.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Agricultural Runoff: From the Everglades Agricultural Area and other agricultural regions.
    *   Urban Runoff: From South Florida.
    *   Altered Hydrology: Changes in freshwater inflow from the Everglades.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Light Availability (the critical factor).
    *   Algal Blooms.
    *   Seagrass Die-offs.

**Logic Description:** Water quality degradation, primarily due to nutrient pollution and altered freshwater inflow from the Everglades, is the *major* driver of seagrass loss in Florida Bay. This has led to large-scale seagrass die-offs and ecosystem shifts.

### Stressor: Physical Damage (Boats)

**Metric:** Area of seagrass scarred by boat propellers; number of boating accidents in seagrass areas.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Aerial surveys.
    *   Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) data.

**Impact on Area:** Direct damage to seagrass; fragmentation.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Habitat loss.
    *   Slow recovery.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   High Boating Traffic: In shallow waters.
    *   Lack of Boater Education.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Habitat Loss (localized).

**Logic Description:** Boat propeller scarring is a significant problem in Florida Bay due to the shallow waters and extensive seagrass beds.

### Stressor: Climate Change (Florida/Gulf)

**Metric:** Sea surface temperature, ocean acidification, sea level, storm intensity.

**Data Sources:**
   * Climate models
    * Historical data.

**Impact on Area:** Die-offs, distribution changes.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
 * Species stress.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
 * Global GHG emissions.

**Influences (Stressors):**
 * Sea Level Rise
  * Ocean acidification.

**Logic Description:**  Climate change stressors impact.
