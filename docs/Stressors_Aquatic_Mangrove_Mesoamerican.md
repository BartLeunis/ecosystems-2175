## Mesoamerican Mangroves

### Stressor: Coastal Development

**Metric:** Area of mangroves converted to tourism infrastructure, urban areas, or aquaculture (ha/year).

**Data Sources:**
    *   Remote sensing data.
    *   Government statistics (Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras).
    *   Reports from conservation organizations.

**Impact on Area:** *Major* loss of mangrove habitat; fragmentation.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Loss of habitat.
    *   Reduced nursery grounds for fish.
    *   Loss of coastal protection.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Tourism Development: A *major* driver, particularly in areas like the Riviera Maya.
    *   Aquaculture Expansion: Shrimp farming.
    *   Population Growth.
    *   Government Policies.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Coastal Erosion.
    *   Water Quality.

**Logic Description:** Coastal development, particularly for tourism and aquaculture, is a *dominant* threat to Mesoamerican mangroves, leading to significant habitat loss.

### Stressor: Pollution

**Metric:** Concentrations of pollutants (nutrients, pesticides, etc.) in water and sediments.

**Data Sources:**
    *   Water quality monitoring data (often limited).
    *   Research studies.

**Impact on Area:** Water quality degradation.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
    *   Impacts on mangroves and associated fauna.
    *   Eutrophication.

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
    *   Agricultural Runoff.
    *   Urban Runoff.
    *   Tourism Activities.
    *   Inadequate Wastewater Treatment.

**Influences (Stressors):**
    *   Water Quality.
    *   Mangrove Health.

**Logic Description:** Pollution from agriculture, urban areas, and tourism degrades water quality and impacts mangrove ecosystems.

### Stressor: Climate Change (Mesoamerican Mangroves)

**Metric:** Sea level rise; temperature increase; storm intensity.

**Data Sources:**
    * Climate Models
 * Historical records

**Impact on Area:** Inundation; erosion; storm damage.

**Impact on Biodiversity:**
 * Species shifts
  * Increased Stress

**Influenced By (Stressors):**
 * Global GHG

**Influences (Stressors):**
 * Sea Level Rise
  * Storm Surge

**Logic Description:** Climate change, particularly sea level rise and increased storm intensity, poses a significant threat.
